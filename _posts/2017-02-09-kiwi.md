<h2>Morning Report: 07.00 London</h2>
<p>This morning, the New Zealand dollar is falling heavily after strong selling yesterday. The RBNZ gave strong signals last night that rates will stay on hold until mid-2019. The NZD/USD is off by 0.86% this morning and -1.59% on the week.</p>
<p>The dollar pairs are generally on the back foot though as the US dollar index regains ground. The AUD/USD is holding up well despite its neighbour's troubles.</p>
<p>The USD/JPY is pushing higher but remains around the lows.</p>

<h2>Coming up today</h2>
<p>Coming up today, we have USÂ unemployment claims at 13.30, the Canadian NHPI at the same time.</p>
<p>UK BOE governor Carney speaks at 18.30</p>
<h2>Trade Idea</h2>
<p>Gold has been a consistent winner of late as global unrest increases, ongoing concerns over Trump, Greek debt and Brexit.</p>
