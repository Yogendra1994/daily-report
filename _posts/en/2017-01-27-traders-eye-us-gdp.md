## Morning Report: 07.00 London

This morning, the US dollar is on the rise for the second day in a row ahead of todayâ€™s US GDP data which is expected to make small losses. Yesterday, the dollar rose despite an unexpected increase in US unemployment rates and slower than expected US new home sales.

Elsewhere, the British pound is under performing as Theresa May meets Donald Trump. The pound has outperformed its peers this week overall, though.

The USD/JPY is following the general trends and pushing the yen pairs higher this morning.

Gold continues to fall from the highs, slipping to the fourth straight loss in a row.

## Coming up today

Coming up today, we have European M3 money supply at 09.00.

At 13.30, we get advance GDP, released alongside core durable goods orders.

At 15.00, we get revised UoM consumer sentiment.

## Trade Idea

The yen pairs are are pushing higher, while the pound has outperformed this week.
