## Morning Report: 07.00 London

This morning, the US dollar is on the back foot after a weekend of confusion following the implementation of the President Trump’s travel ban from certain Muslim countries. The dollar index gapped lower at the open, though has made back some of these losses as the morning progresses.

Dollar pairs are mixed with the AUD/USD slipping lower, the GBP/USD gapping higher then slipping and the EUR/USD holding early gains.

The USD/JPY and other yen pairs have followed the dollar’s lead and are slipping lower.

The euro appears to be the stronger performer emerging so far this morning, making gains against the dollar and pound.

## Coming up today

Coming up today, we have Spanish Flash GDP at 08.00.

This is followed by Core US Core PCE price index at 13.30 and personal spending at the same time.

US pending home sales follow at 15.00.

## Trade Idea

The NZD/USD has enjoyed a surge in interest in the last month or so and this morning’s dip could be another good chance to reload.
