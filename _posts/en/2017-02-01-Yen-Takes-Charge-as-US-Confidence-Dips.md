## Morning Report: 07.00 London

The US dollar index came in for heavy selling yesterday as Chicago PMI and Consumer Confidence dropped more than expected. There is a mini-recovery in place this morning though after Chinese PMI came in slightly above expectations.

Dollar pairs enjoyed broad gains, with the EUR/USD setting the pace and the GBP/USD bouncing back. Those dollar pairs have eased back this morning as we look ahead to some major US data today.

The yen pairs saw the biggest losses, though the USD/JPY bounced off the highs and is pushing higher again this morning.

The NZD/USD is struggling after weaker than expected employment data.

## Coming up today

Coming up today, we have UK manufacturing PMI at 09.30.

At 13.15, we get US ADP non-farm employment change.

Following this, we get ISM manufacturing PMI at 15.00.

At 15.30, we get crude oil inventories.

The main items are the FOMC statement at 19.00, with the federal fundâ€™s rate at the same time.

## Trade Idea

Gold enjoyed strong gains yesterday, putting the highs back within reach. With the dollar under pressure right now and global unrest causing traders to reach for safe havens, there could be further upside from here.
