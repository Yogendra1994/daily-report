<h2>Morning Report: 07.00 London</h2>
The US dollar halted its decline yesterday after the FOMC voted to keep rates on hold, while ADP payrolls and ISM manufacturing PMI both came in above expectations. The selling has started again this morning though with the dollar index hitting its lowest levels since November.

The yen eased back yesterday, with the USD/JPY finding support in the 112.50 region, but this support line is under pressure this morning as the yen resumes its dominance.

The euro had a bad day in the office, with the EUR/USD slipping 0.24% while other dollar pairs held their ground. Like other dollar pairs, this move is reversing this morning, with the EUR/USD rallying.

The pound is showing relative strength against all major currencies, especially the euro, with the EUR/GBP falling by around 1.00% over the last two days. UK Manufacturing PMI came out in-line with expectations.

The Australian dollar is the star performer this morning though despite the conflict between Trump and Turbull over refugees. The AUD/USD is up 0.8%.

<h2>Coming up today</h2>

Coming up today, we have UK construction PMI at 09.30.

This is followed by the MPC rate statement and inflation report. No change is expected here. Governor Carney speaks at 12.30.

At 12.15, ECB president Draghi speaks.

At 13.30, we have unemployment claims, released alongside preliminary nonfarm productivity and unit labour costs.

<h2>Trade Idea</h2>

The USD/JPY has found support in the 112.50 region, but general trend remains bearish, with further selling this morning.
