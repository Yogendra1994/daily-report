## Morning Report: 07.00 London

This morning, the dollar index is holding ground after a solid bounce off the lows yesterday. US unemployment claims came in above expectations yesterday.

The yen is giving up some ground after the USD/JPY bounce off the 112.50 level again.

The pound is nudging higher after heavy selling yesterday that saw the GBP/USD slump and the GBP/JPY mark losses of over 2% on the week. UK growth forecasts were upgraded, but Mark Carney cautioned that there are some severe risks ahead.

It was a solid day yesterday for the AUD/USD and the pair is holding ground again this morning despite below par Caixin Manufacturing PMI.

## Coming up today

Coming up, we have UK services PMI at 09.30.

This is followed by US average hourly earnings, the unemployment rate and the all important Non Farm Employment change.

FOMC member Evans speaks at 14.15.

At 15.00, we get ISM non manufacturing PMI and factory orders.

## Trade Idea

The pound and Australian dollar headed in different directions yesterday and this could continue as the UK economy faces risks from Brexit uncertainty.
