## Morning Report: 07.00 London

This morning, the US dollar is back on the rise after an indifferent session on Friday. US Non Farm Payrolls came in above expectations, but wage growth slowed.

The USD/JPY continues to mirror the dollar index, with small gains this morning after minor losses on Friday.

Elsewhere, the dollar pairs are generally on the back foot, with the AUD/USD and EUR/USD off by 0.33% and 0.21%. The pound is holding up relatively well, with the GBP/USD unchanged this morning and the EUR/GBP off by 0.20%.

## Coming up today

There are no economic items of note today with European Sentix Investor Confidence probably of most interest from the low tier items.

## Trade Idea

The Australian dollar is struggling this morning, in line with other dollar pairs. The AUD/USD is slipping back, but the trend remains firmly positive.
