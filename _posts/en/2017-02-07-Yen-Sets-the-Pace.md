## Morning Report: 07.00 London

This morning, the Japanese yen is setting the pace as traders seek out a safe haven in the face of global uncertainty. Trump’s travel ban and uncertainty over French elections have pushed money into the perceived safety of the Japanese yen. The yen pairs are mixed this morning after heavy selling yesterday. The EUR/JPY has seen the biggest losses so far this week, falling around 1.5%.

The dollar index itself has risen for the second straight day, showing that the yen’s accent isn’t at the expense of the US dollar.

Elsewhere, gold continues to shine with the precious metal breaking through $1230.

## Coming up today

Coming up today, we have the UK Halifax HPI at 08.30.

This is followed by Canadian trade balance at 13.30, with building permits released at the same time. US trade balance comes out at the same time.

At 15.00, we have Ivey PMI. US JOLTS job openings appear at the same time.

## Trade Idea

The Yen continues to be the power currency, with the USD/JPY finally breaking the 112.50 barrier yesterday. There could be further downside from here as the weak dollar/strong yen trend continues.
