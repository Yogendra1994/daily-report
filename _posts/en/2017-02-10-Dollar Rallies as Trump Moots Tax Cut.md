## Morning Report: 07.00 London

This morning, the US dollar is unchanged after solid gains yesterday on the back of Trumpâ€™s mooted tax cuts.

The yen pairs have been the big gainers as the yen softens. The AUD/ JPY is the start performer, up 0.70%, this comes after Chinese trade balance rose more than expected. The GBP/ JPY is up 0.56%, with the EUR/ JPY up 0.46%.

The dollar pairs are mixed again with the AUD/ USD the top performer and the EUR/ USD lagging as Greek debt negotiations stumble forward.

## Coming up today

Coming up today, we have UK manufacturing production at 09.30. Goods trade balance is released at the same time.

At 13.30, we get Canadian employment change and unemployment rate. US import prices are released at the same time.

At 15.00, we get preliminary UoM customer sentiment.

## Trade Idea

The euro has underperformed once again as familiar fault lines emerge. Meanwhile, the Australian dollar continues to outperform, putting pressure on the EUR/ AUD.
