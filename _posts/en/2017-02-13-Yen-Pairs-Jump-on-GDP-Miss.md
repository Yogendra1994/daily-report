## Morning Report: 07.00 London


This morning, the yen pairs have gapped higher after Japanese GDP increased less than expected. The likes of the USD/ JPY jumped higher at the new week open, but have since fallen back towards Fridayâ€™s close. The AUD/ JPY is holding those gaps higher though.

The dollar pairs are mixed as the dollar index weakens this morning.

The euro continues to struggle in the face of Greek debt worries, with the EUR/ GBP gapping lower this morning.

## Coming up today

We have a quiet day on the economic front this morning with no middle or top tier items to be aware of.

## Trade Idea

Silver has rallied along with gold recently, but has done so largely under the radar.
