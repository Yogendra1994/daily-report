## Morning Report: 07.00 London

This morning, the yen pairs are on the back foot, as traders seek out safe havens following Toshiba's failure to announce earnings as expected. The yen is in control this morning, with the USD/ JPY off by 0.24%.

The dollar pairs are mixed, with the AUD/ USD up by 0.43%, but the EUR/ USD is lagging, up just 0.24%. 

The Aussie is out performing thanks to better than expected Chinese data this morning. 

The euro continues to lag, with the EUR/ GBP struggling after hefty selling over the last week.

## Coming up today

Today we have UK CPI at 09.30, released alongside PPI input and RPI. 

European Flash GDP follows at 10.00. 

At 13.30, we get US PPI, followed by Fed Chair Yellen speaking at 15.00. 

At 18.00, FOMC member Kaplan speaks.

## Trade Idea

The euro continues to struggle while the Aussie benefits from its close proximity to China. 

A good way to play this is a LOWER trade predicting that the EUR/ AUD will close below 1.3750 in 14 days for a potential return of 157%
