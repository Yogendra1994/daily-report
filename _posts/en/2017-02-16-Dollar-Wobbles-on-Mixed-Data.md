## Morning Report: 07.00 London

This morning, the dollar is unchanged after a minor wobble yesterday. US data was decidedly mixed as CPI and retail sales came in better than expected. However, capacity utilisation and industrial production came in below estimates. 

The USD/JPY has followed suit, with the dollar losing ground against the yen. 

The euro has recovered ground this week as investors look for positive signs in Greek debt negotiations. The EUR/GBP looks set to rise for the third straight day. 

The Australian dollar is off the boil despite better than expected employment data, with the AUD/JPY peeling back this morning.

## Coming up today

Coming up today, we have the release of the ECB policy meeting acounts at 12.30. 

Following this at 13.30, we get US building permits, Philly Fed manufacturing index and unemployment claims.

## Trade Idea

The EUR/USD has risen for the last two days, but this could be a flash in the pan as pressure remains on Greek debt negotiations. 

A good way to play this is a LOWER trade predicting that the EUR/USD will close below 1.0600 in 14 days for a potential return of 112%.
