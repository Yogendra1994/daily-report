## Morning Report: 07.00 London

This morning, the euro is steady after outsized gains yesterday on the back of largely dovish, but reassuring meeting minutes from the ECB. The EUR/USD is off slightly this morning, but up 0.24% on the week. The EUR/GBP is off slightly, but yesterday's gains are looking untroubled. 

The euro continues to drive the key trends, with the USD/JPY unchanged after big losses yesterday. Other yen pairs are on the back foot with the exception of the EUR/JPY, which was unchanged yesterday. 

The US dollar index is unchanged after minor losses yesterday.

## Coming up today

Coming up today, we have UK retail sales at 09.30. 

Canadian foreign securities purchases follows at 13.30.

## Trade Idea

The euro out-performed yesterday, but this comes despite no real progress in Greek debt negotiations. This could bring about a reversal in fortunes for euro pairs, particularly the EUR/AUD.
