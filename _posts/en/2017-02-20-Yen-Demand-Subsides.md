## Morning Report: 07.00 London

This morning, the yen pairs are reversing last week's losses after a rousing rally from Trump in Florida over the weekend. The AUD/JPY is up 0.54%, with the USD/JPY up 0.31%. The likes of the EUR/JPY have some way to go to recover Friday's losses however. 

The dollar pairs have reversed some of Friday's losses, gapping up this morning. The EUR/USD is up slightly, but still well down on Friday's close. 

Against the pound, the euro is slipping back after as volatile session on Friday after UK retail sales came in below estimates.
