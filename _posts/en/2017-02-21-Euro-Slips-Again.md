## Morning Report: 07.00 London

This morning, the euro remains under pressure after Matteo Renzi resigned as PM of Italy in a bid to spark a leadership contest. This comes amid political uncertainty in France and looming German elections. The EUR/GBP is off by 0.16% this morning after a poor day yesterday, with corresponding falls in the EUR/USD and other euro pairs. 

Elsewhere, the US dollar index is on the rise, with the main dollar pairs stuck in a tight range these last few weeks. 

The yen pairs look set to rise for the second day in a row, with the USD/JPY up, but the AUD/JPY struggling.

## Coming up today

Coming up today, we have French flash manufacturing PMI, released alongside French services PMI at 08.00. 

At 08.30, we get the corresponding German data, followed by the pan EU data at 09.00. 

At 09.30, we get public sector net borrowing. 

FOMC member Kashkari speaks at 13.50.

## Trade Idea

The euro continues to face many headwinds and while the pound is no bed of roses, the EUR/GBP could have further to fall.
