## Morning Report: 07.00 London

This morning, the dollar is holding steady at the lows after a relatively muted reaction to the Fed meeting minutes pointed to a US rate hike fairly soon. In addition, there remains significant uncertainty about White House policies. 

The USD/JPY Is on the back foot, as the dollar loses ground to the yen. 

Meanwhile, the euro has recovered these last two days, with the EUR/GBP pushing up despite UK second estimate coming in above expectations. The euro has been lifted by speculation that Le Pen's election chances are lower than previously expected.

## Coming up today

Coming up today, we have US unemployment claims at 13.30. 

Following this, we get crude oil inventories at 16.00.

## Trade Idea

The prospect of a US rate hike hasn't really dulled the shine of the dollar pairs, especially the AUD/USD. A rate hike has been well telegraphed, with further hikes likely to be slow in the face of Trump uncertainty.
