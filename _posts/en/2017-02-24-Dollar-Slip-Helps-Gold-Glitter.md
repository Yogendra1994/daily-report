## Morning Report: 07.00 London

This morning, the dollar is posting small gains after hefty selling yesterday on the back of a small rise in US unemployment claims. 

The weaker dollar is driving the USD/JPY lower. The pair is making slight gains this morning, but the trend remains negative. 

Gold has enjoyed a two day spurt, rising above the recent highs. 

Elsewhere, the euro took a hit yesterday, with the EUR/GBP erasing Wednesday's gains. There are small gains this morning.

## Coming up today

Coming up today, we have Canadian CPI at 13.30 data. 

Following this, we get US new home sales and revised UoM consumer sentiment.

## Trade Idea

Gold made outsized gains these last two days as the recent highs are finally breached.

Gold trends can run and run which makes a HIGHER trade look attractive, especially as interest rate expectations cool off.
