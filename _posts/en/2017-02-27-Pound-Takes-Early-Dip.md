## Morning Report: 07.00 London

This morning, the British pound is on the back foot on rumours of a second Scottish referendum to coincide with the triggering of article 50. The EUR/GBP is off by 0.5%, with the GBP/JPY down 0.3%.

The Australian dollar is out performing, with the GBP/AUD down 0.52% and the AUD/JPY up 0.29%. 

The yen pairs are holding at the lows, with the USD/JPY unchanged so far. 

The dollar gapped higher at the open, but has since slipped back to trade unchanged.

## Coming up today

Coming up today, we have Spanish Flash CPI at 08.00. European money supply follows at 09.00. 

At 13.30, we get core US durable goods orders, followed by pending home sales at 15.00.

## Trade Idea

The USD/JPY lost its relentless downtrend, but the pair is challenging the lows once again.
