## Morning Report: 07.00 London

It was a poor start to the week for the Canadian dollar yesterday as oil prices slipped to below $55.00. The USD/CAD is now up 0.65% on the week. 

Elsewhere, the British pound continued its weak run, with the EUR/GBP rising another 0.25% this morning, on the back of further selling yesterday. 

The yen pairs are mixed, with the GBP/JPY a standout loser, down 0.43% this morning. 

Elsewhere, the US dollar is on the back foot after a volatile session that ended with the dollar index higher.

## Coming up today

Coming up today, we have US preliminary GDP at 13.30, followed by Chicago PMI at 14.45. 

At 15.00, we get CB consumer confidence.

## Trade Idea

The pound has lost some of its post Brexit shine, while the yen continues to find buyers. There could be further downside ahead as Brexit wrangling continues.
