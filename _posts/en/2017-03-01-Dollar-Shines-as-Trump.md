## Morning Report: 07.00 London

The dollar index is on a rally at the moment, with gains this morning on the back of yesterday's positive session. Trump's speech before Congress hit the right notes for dollar hawks. Despite a lack of firm details, the dollar pairs are on the back foot, with the likes of the EUR/USD and AUD/USD in partiular making gains. The NZD/USD is lagging however. 

The yen pairs have been following suit, with the USD/JPY and other yen pairs on the rise. 

While the AUD/USD has been buoyed by better than expected GDP data, the NZD/USD is lagging. Another major commodity currency, the Canadian dollar is also struggling as oil prices slip again.

## Coming up today

Coming up this morning, we have German unemployment change at 08.55. 

At 09.30, we have UK manufacturing PMI, released alongside net lending to individuals. 

At 13.30, we have Canadian current account data, released alongside US core PCE and personal spending data. 

At 15.00, we have the BOC rate statement. 

Also at 15.00, we get ISM manufacturing PMI. 

Following this, we get crude oil inventories at 15.30.

## Trade Idea

The dollar has got its groove on as expectations rise for a forthcoming rate hike. Meanwhile, the NZD/USD is under performing, falling behind its Australian neighbour.
