## Morning Report: 07.00 London

This morning, the US dollar has a slight negative bias, but so far the gains made this week remain unchallenged. Yesterday's gains came on the back of better than expected US ISM Manufacturing PMI. 

The USD/JPY and other yen pairs continue to ride higher with the dollar. The USD/JPY is setting the pace, while the AUD/JPY out-performs. 

The pound slipped yesterday after UK manufacturing PMI came in below expectations.

The USD/CAD continued to rally on the strong dollar and indifferent oil price action.

## Coming up today

Coming up today we have UK construction PMI at 09.30. 

At 13.30, we get Canadian GDP, released alongside US unemployment claims.

## Trade Idea

The euro has come under pressure along with other dollar pairs this last week and it could pay to ride this trend lower.
