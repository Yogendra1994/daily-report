## Morning Report: 07.00 London

This morning, the dollar index has paused after making strong gains throughout this week as investors await a Speech from Fed chair Yellen. Analysts expect further confirmation that a rate rise is on the card this month. 

The strong dollar has hurt commodities and commodity currencies in particular. Oil prices and gold have taken a hit this week, while the USD/CAD has risen and the AUD/ USD sunk yesterday. 

The dollar pairs are mixed this morning, the EUR/USD is on the rise, while most other pairs continue to struggle. 

The USD/JPY has followed the dollar higher, but is peeling back at a faster pace this morning.

## Coming up today

Coming up today we have UK services PMI at 09.30. 

Following this, we have US ISM non-manufacturing PMI  at 15.00. 

Following this, we have a number of FOMC speeches, starting with Evans at 15.15, Powell at 17.15 and Fed chair Yellen at 18.00.

## Trade Idea

Lower oil prices and a stronger dollar have hurt the Canadian dollar this week.

With a rate rise on the cards and Trump's energy policy potentially increasing oil supply, there could be further bad news for the 'Loonie'.
