## Morning Report: 07.00 London

This morning traders are reaching for safe havens after North Korea launched missiles, some of which landed in Japanese controlled waters. The USD/JPY has gapped lower, while other yen pairs are struggling. 

The EUR/JPY is experiencing the biggest declines, as the euro unwinds Friday's spectacular rally. The EUR/USD made huge gains on opinion polls that put Le Pen in third place. 

Meanwhile, the NZD/USD has continued its decline on expectations of slow Chinese growth.

## Coming up today

Today we have MPC member Hogg speaking at 11.30. 

Following this at 11.30, we have US factory orders. 

FOMC member Kashkari speaks at 20.00.

## Trade Idea

The NZD/USD continues to fall off the pace as dollar rate hike speculation continues.
