## Morning Report: 07.00 London

This morning, the US dollar is slipping back after yesterday's gains. 

The dollar pairs are mixed, with gains for the AUD/ USD and EUR/USD but losses for the GBP/ USD.

The pound is lagging on the prospect of Brexit snags today as the house of Lords vote on the Brexit bill. 

Meanwhile gold continues to lose its shine despite the dollar falling off the pace.

## Coming up today

Today we have UK halifax HPI at 08.30. 

This is followed by Canadian trade balance at 13.30. Ivey PMI follows at 15.00

## Trade Idea

The GBP/AUD is the top loser this morning as the weak pound comes up against the strong Aussie dollar. 

Today's Brexit vote could produce further issues for the pound at a time that the Aussie is enjoying out performance.
