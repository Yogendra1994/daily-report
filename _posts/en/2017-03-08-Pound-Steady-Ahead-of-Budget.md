## Morning Report: 07.00 London

This morning, the British pound is steady ahead of Chancellor Hammond's first budget. Sterling has been weak throughout the week, with the EUR/GBP posting major gains since February 28th. Pound pairs are relatively steady this morning though. 

Elsewhere, the yen pairs are on the back foot, with the USD/JPY down 0.23% and the GBP/JPY continuing its downtrend. 

Gold is unchanged, but is at least halting its decline seen since Feb 27th.

## Coming up today

The UK budget release is at 12.30. 

Following this at 13.15, we get ADP non-far, employment change. 

At 13.30, we get Canadian building permits and labor productivity. 

US Revised nonfarm productivity is released at 13.30.

Finally at 15.30, we have US crude oil inventories

## Trade Idea

Today's budget is unlikely to alter the impact of global issues including a stronger yen and concerns over Brexit uncertainty.
