## Morning Report: 07.00 London

This morning, the US dollar continues to sparkle after yesterday's better than expected ADP payroll data. The dollar remains elevanted and the dollar pairs depressed as rate hike expectations increase. 

The likes of the EUR/USD and GBP/USD are on the back foot this morning, while the NZD/USD is continuing its selling run. The USD/CAD is a big mover in particular yesterday, rallying hard as oil prices plunged due to US inventory numbers. 

The yen pairs are mixed, with the USD/JPY unchanged and the GBP/JPY easing back after small gainsn yesterday.

## Coming up today

Today we have the ECB minimum bid rate at 12.45 and press conference at 13.30. No change is expected. 

At 13.30, we get the latest US unemployment claims and import prices.

## Trade Idea

Silver fell from grace spectacularly at the start of March fter months of consistent gains. 

Both gold and silver have the tendancy to recover after sharp falls like this, so now could be a good opportunity to buy a rebound.
