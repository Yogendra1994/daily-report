## Morning Report: 07.00 London

The US dollar has softened slightly this morning ahead of today's Non Farm Payrolls. Analysts are expecting gains in the region of 200k. Anything approaching this could see another boost for the dollar on speculation that there will be four rate hikes this year, not the three previously expected. Most dollar pairs are up this morning, against the dominant trend of the week. 

While the dollar is rallying, the yen is struggling, boosting the USD/JPY and other yen pairs. The EUR/JPY has rallied well in particular these last three days. 

The pound remains soft though, as evidenced by the EUR/GBP three day rally. 

Commodities remain under pressure with oil firmly below $53 and gold stuck in a steady down trend.

## Coming up today

Coming up today, we have UK manufacturing production at 09.30, released alongside goods trade balance. 

The day's main item is US Non Farm Payrolls at 13.30, released alongside the unemployment rate and average hourly earnings. 

Corresponding Canadian data is released at the same time.

## Trade Idea

The NZD/USD is making a small rebound after weeks of consistent losses recently. With a strong prospect of further dollar gains today, we could see the NZD/USD resume its downswing.
