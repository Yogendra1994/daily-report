## Morning Report: 07.00 London

The dollar is weaker again this morning, despite Friday's stronger than expected US payrolls data. The move is in part being fuelled by a resurgent euro with the EUR/USD flying higher on the back of hawkish ECB comments and opinion polls pointing away from a Le Pen victory in France.

Dollar pairs are on the rise, with the EUR/USD capping Friday's gains. The EUR/GBP also spiked higher on Friday and is rallying again this morning. 

The top performers are the Australian and New Zealand dollars this morning. 

Commodities are mixed, with gold recovering slightly, but oil prices continuing to slump.

## Coming up today

Coming up today, we have ECB president Draghi speaking at 13.30. 

## Trade Idea

The EUR/GBP has spiked higher of late, helped speculation that the government will trigger article 50 this week. 

That reaction may not be a full gone conclusion as the pound has reacted in strange ways around Brexit. The EUR/GBP spiked on the election result, but has oscillated back and forth since then.
