## Morning Report: 07.00 London

This morning, the US dollar index is on the rise after small losses yesterday as traders adjust their positions ahead of tomorrow's expected rate rise. 

The USD/JPY is pushing higher, with other yen pairs mixed. The EUR/JPY is on the rise, while the GBP/JPY struggles. 

The pound is struggling this morning as traders sweat over the latest Brexit complication in the form of a second referendum request from Nicola Sturgeon. The GBP/USD is off by 0.64%, with the EUR/GBP up 0.50%

## Coming up today

Coming up today, we have German ZEW economic sentiment at 10.00. 

US PPI follows at 12.30. 

## Trade Idea

There were signs of a positive reaction to Brexit this week in the GBP/USD, but this has been sideswiped this morning as Scottish independence causes complications.
