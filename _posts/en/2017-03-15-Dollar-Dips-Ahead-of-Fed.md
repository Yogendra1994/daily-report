## Morning Report: 07.00 London

This morning, the US dollar has dipped ahead of the all important FOMC policy statement this evening. Analysts expected a rise in rates to 1%, but the key will be projections for the future and the speed of future rate rises. 

The dollar pairs are on the rise this morning, especially the GBP/USD as the pound gains strength in the face of Brexit uncertainty. The GBP/USD is up 0.54%, with the EUR/GBP dropping another 0.31%

Elsewhere, the AUD/USD continues to recover, while the NZD/USD remains rangebound at the lows. 

The USD/CAD is pausing at the highs after a surge from late February.

## Coming up today

Coming up today, we have UK claimant count change date, released alongside average earnings and the unemployment rate. 

At 12.30, we have CPI and retail sales date. 

Crude oil inventories are released at 14.30. 

The main event is the FOMC statement and economic projections at 18.00. The press conference follows at 18.30

## Trade Idea

The EUR/GBP has continued its down swing after a brief Scottish independence curve-ball. Markets like certainty and at the very least, the Brexit trigger will provide some certainty for traders which could mean lower prices for the EUR/GBP.
