## Morning Report: 07.00 London

This morning, the dollar remains subdued after heavy selling yesterday on the back of the Fed meeting which many saw as cautious and pointing to a slower rate increase in the future. The dollar index plunged, while the dollar pairs and commodities enjoyed healthy gains. 

The biggest gains were seen on the EUR/USD which was strengthened by the Dutch election results. 

The Australian dollar has cut back this morning on weak employment data, but the AUD/USD remains the top performer this week after yesterday's rally. 

The USD/JPY looks set for some follow on selling this morning after picking up losses yesterday.

Meanwhile, gold and silver are enjoying their best session in weeks.


## Coming up today

Coming up today, we have the UK rate statement at 12.00, with no change expected. 

Canadian foreign securities purchases follow at 12.30

At the same time from the US we get building permits, Philly Fed Manufacturing and unemployment claims. 

US JOLTS job openings follow at 13.00


## Trade Idea

The USD/JPY is slipping lower and there could well be further downside as analysts adjust their forecasts.
