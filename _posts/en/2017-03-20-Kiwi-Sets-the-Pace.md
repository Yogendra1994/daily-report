## Morning Report: 07.00 London

This morning, the US dollar is continuing it's down trend following the FOMC meeting last week, with the dollar index struggling again. The weekend's G20 meeting has failed to arrest this decline, especially with a notable change to the statement which excluded a committment to avoid protectionism. 

The yen continues to gain ground, with the USD/JPY slipping lower again. 

The euro is picking up some of the pips lost last week, especially against the pound with the EUR/GBP up this morning. 

The top performer is the NZD/USD which is up 0.44%, along with the AUD/USD, up 0.33%.


## Coming up today

Coming up today, we have Canadian Wholsale Sales at 12.30. 

This is followed by German Buba President speaking Weidmann at 16.45. 

FOMC member Evans speaks at 17.10, with MPC member Haldane speaking at 18.20.

President Trump speaks at 23.30.


## Trade Idea

The NZD/USD is leading this morning, but has lagged the AUD/USD since the FOMC meeting rebound.
