## Morning Report: 07.00 London

This morning, the euro is rallying after a mildly positive response to last night's televised French presedential elections. The EUR/USD is up 0.56%, with the EUR/USD up 0.37%. 

Meanwhile, the Australian dollar is struggling, taking a negative interpretation of the latest RBA meeting minutes. This comes the AUD/USD made multi month highs last night. The NZD/USD is following suit. 

The USD/JPY has recovered somewhat, while the US dollar index remains largely unchanged. 

After a strong rally in recent days, gold is slipping back this morning.


## Coming up today

Coming up today, we have UK inflation data with CPI, RPI, public sector net borrowing and PPI at 09.30. 

At 10.35, we have Governor Carney speaking. FOMC member Dudley speaks at the same time. 

At 12.30, we have Canadian core retail sales, released alongside US current account.


## Trade Idea

Gold has had a good run, but is slipping back this morning. The US dollar is still depressed though, making this a good time to buy the dip.
