## Morning Report: 07.00 London

World markets are steadying themselves this morning after the first major stock market correction of the Trump reign last night. The dollar index remains subdued, but the Japanese yen has picked up the pace with the yen pairs slipping lower again. 

The Australian dollar is unchanged so far this morning after heavy selling yesterday. The AUD/JPY is the worst performer on the week so far, down 1.50%.

Meanwhile, the pound is performing relatively well after UK inflation came in above expectations yesterday.


## Coming up today

Coming up today, we have US home sales at 14.00, followed by crude oil inventories at 14.30. 

At 20.00, we have the rate statement from the RBNZ.


## Trade Idea

The yen is in demand as investors flee to the perceived safe haven. Confidence in Trump is dropping in line with expectations for the US dollar.
