## Morning Report: 07.00 London

This morning, the US dollar is staging a recovery despite yesterday's delay in the introduction of 'Trumpcare' there is another attempt to get the bill passed today. 

The USD/JPY is on the rise, helped by the recoverying dollar. The AUD/JPY still remains the week's poor performer though. 

Dollar pairs are on the back foot, with the AUD/USD continuing its down trend and is now down over 1% on the week. The NZD/USD is the worst performing currency so far today. 

Meanwhile, the pound is lagging as the euro makes up some ground.


## Coming up today

Coming up today we have a slew of European data points, starting with French manufacturing and services PMI. 

Following this we get the corresponding German data, with pan European data at 09.00. 

FOMC member Evans speaks at 12.00. 

At 12.30, we gave Canadian CPI data. 

At the same time, we get US core durable goods orders.


## Trade Idea

The Australian dollar has continued to perform poorly this week and there is room for further downside.
