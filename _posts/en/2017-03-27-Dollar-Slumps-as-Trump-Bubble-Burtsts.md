## Morning Report: 07.00 London

This morning, the US dollar has slumped as markets absorb the implications of Trump's failure to pass his alternative healthcare act. The real concern is that it means that Trump's other market friendly policies such as tax cuts will not come to pass. 

The dollar pairs are on the rise, led by the GBP/USD and EUR/USD.

Elsewhere, the yen pairs are the top movers, with the USD/JPY off by nearly 1.00%. The AUD/JPY is falling by similar margin. 

Gold continues to recover with the precious metal and silver benefitting from the dollar slump.


## Coming up today

Coming up today, we have German Ifo business climate at 08.00, released alongnside M3 money supply. 

At 17.15, we get FOMC member Evans speaking, followed by member Kaplan speaking at 22.30.


## Trade Idea

The USD/JPY has gapped lower this morning, but there could be even more downside to come from here. 

The Trump rally was arguably overdone, so the reaction this hurdle could run further than expected.
