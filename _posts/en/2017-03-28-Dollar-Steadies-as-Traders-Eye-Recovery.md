## Morning Report: 07.00 London

This morning, the US dollar is steady after yesterday's opening gap lower. 

The USD/JPY rallied yesterday, but not enough to close the gap and is once again on the back foot this morning. 

The dollar pairs are on the back foot, with the GBP/USD and EUR/USD seeing small falls after yesterday's rally, while the AUD/USD continues its slump.


## Coming up today

Coming up today, we have US CB consumer confidence at 14.00. 

At 14.10, we get BOC governor Poloz speaking. 

FOMC member Kaplan speaks at 17.00


## Trade Idea

The AUD/ JPY is one of the worst performing major currency pairs in the last month and this could continue as the dollar undwinds and money flows back into the yen.
