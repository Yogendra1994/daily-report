## Morning Report: 07.00 London

This morning, the British pound remains under pressure and is the worst performing currency this morning and this week. This GBP/USD fell sharply yesterday as Theresa May formerly signed article 50. 

The dollar continues to recover, helped by strong US consumer confidence data. 

Meanwhile, the USD/JPY remains above the highs after a solid recovery yesterday. 

The AUD/USD and AUD/JPY are on the back foot after a strong rebound yesterday.


## Coming up today

We start the day with UK net lending for individuals at 08.30. 

FOMC member Evans speaks at 13.20. 

US Pending home sales follow at 14.00.

Cruide oil inventories follow at 14.30.


## Trade Idea

The GBP/JPY has been in a long slow decline over the last couple of months and article 50 could spur further selling.
