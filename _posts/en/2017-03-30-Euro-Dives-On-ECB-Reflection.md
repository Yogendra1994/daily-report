## Morning Report: 07.00 London

This morning, markets are relatively quiet as traders await the latest US GDP figures. The euro is in recovery mode as traders make sense of yesterday's heavy selling. The euro is now the weakest performing major on the week after comments from unnamed sources forced a rethink on the ECB's perceived strategy. All euro pairs saw hefty selling, in particular the EUR/GBP. 

Elsewhere, the dollar and yen are mostly unchanged this morning. 

The Australian and New Zealand dollars remain under pressure with the Aussie reversing yesterday's gains. 


## Coming up today

Coming up today, we have Canadian RMPI at 12.30, released alongside US final GDP and unemployment claims. 

At 15.00, we get FOMC member Kaplan speaking.


## Trade Idea

Much had been made of the pound's weakness around the triggering of article 50, but the euro itself has its own problems. 

The yen pairs have a negative bias and this could well force the EUR/JPY lower.
