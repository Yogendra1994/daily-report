This morning, the euro continues to slip lower after heavy selling over the last two days. The EUR/GBP came in for sustained selling yesterday, while other euro pairs continued to under perform. 

Meanwhile, the dollar's recovery remains on track after US GDP came in above expectations. 

The yen pairs continue to climb, mirroring the US dollar's gains. 

The AUD/USD and NZD/USD continue to suffer though with both pairs underperforming over the last two days.


## Coming up today

Coming up today, we have German unemployment change at 07.55. 

This is followed by UK current account and GDP data at 08.30.

Following this we have Canadian GDP and US core PCE and personal spending.

FOMC member Dudley speaks at 13.00.

## Trade Idea

The New Zealand dollar has lagged its peers over the last month or and this could well continue as the dollar stabilises.
