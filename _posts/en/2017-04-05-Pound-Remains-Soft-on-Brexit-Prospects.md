## Morning Report: 07.00 London

Dollar pairs are mixed this morning as the US Dollar index drifts. 

The AUD/USD is on the rise, making back some of its recent losse, by contrast the GBP/USD and EUR/USD are on the back foot. 

The USD/JPY is also on the back foot as the dollar loses ground to the yen once again.


## Coming up today

Coming up today, we have UK services PMI at 08.30. 

This is followed by US ADP non farm employment change at 12.15. 

At 12.30, we have MPC member Vlieghe speaking. 

At 14.00, we get US ISM non manufacturing PMI followed by crude oil inventories at 14.30. 

Then at 18.00, we get the release of the FOMC meeting minutes.


## Trade Idea

The GBP/JPY is weaker this morning as markets digest the possibility of a Brexit without a deal. 

The pair is already the week's worst performer and this could well continue.
