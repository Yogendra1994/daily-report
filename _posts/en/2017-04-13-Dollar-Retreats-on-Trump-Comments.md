title: "April 13th: Dollar Retreats on Trump Comments"

## Morning Report: 07.00 London

The dollar is on the back foot again this morning on the back of comments from Trump that the Green back was 'too high'.

The move has eased the pressure on the yen pairs, with the USD/JPY and co rallying this morning. 

The AUD/USD is seeing the biggest gains, with the AUD/USD also marking a solid two day rally. Better than expected employment change data is helping the Aussie alongside the weak dollar. 

Gold is easing back slightly after breaking firmly through the $1275 level.  


## Coming up today

Coming up today, we have the UK BOE credit conditions survey.

At 12.30, we get Canadian manufacturing sales, released alongside US PPI and unemployment claims. 

US preliminary UoM consumer sentiment follows at 14.00. 

BOC governor Poloz speaks at 14.30.


## Trade Idea

Gold is worth a look as President Trump gets involved a triangle if issues - Russia, Syria and North Korea. 

As the dollar weakens, there could be further upside from here.
