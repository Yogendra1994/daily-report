## Morning Report: 07.00 London

This morning, the US dollar remains on the front foot despite speculation that Trump's tax reforms will take longer to implement due to the failure to pass the healthcare bill. The geopolitical tensions around North Korea are also playing a part. 

Most yen pairs are unchanged this morning after strong gains yesterday across the board. The AUD/JPY is weak though. 

The Australian dollar is under performing across its various pairings. This follows the release of the last monetary policy meeting minutes. The AUD/JPY is now down nearly 3% for April. 

The British pound is performing well by contrast, with the GBP/JPY up 0.89%. 


## Coming up today

Coming up today, we have US building permits at 12.30, released alongside US housing starts. 

At 13.15, we have US capacity utilisation rates and industrial production.


## Trade Idea

The USD/JPY is unchanged this morning after yesterday's strong rebound. This could be an opportunity to re-load on bearish bets though.
