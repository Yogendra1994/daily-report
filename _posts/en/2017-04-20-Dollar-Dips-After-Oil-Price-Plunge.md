## Morning Report: 07.00 London

This morning, the US dollar is on the back foot after strong gains yesterday which were helped by the collapse in oil prices. 

The dollar pairs are generally performing well, led by the NZD/USD after bigger than expected CPI numbers last night. 

After yesterday's pullback, the pound is back with positive intent, with the EUR/GBP dropping again. 

The yen pairs are mixed, with a slight positive bias so far. 


## Coming up today

Coming up today, we have US Philly Fed manufacturing at 12.30, released alongside US unemployment claims. 

UK BOE governor Carney speaks at 15.30 and 16.30. Followed by Treasury secretary Mnuchin at 17.15.


## Trade Idea

Despite a slight up-tick this morning, the AUD/ JPY's trend remains firmly lower.
