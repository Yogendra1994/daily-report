## Morning Report: 07.00 London

This morning, the euro has leapt higher after the French Presidential elections pushed Emmanuel Macron and Marine Le Pen through to the next round, with Macron in the lead. The EUR/GBP is up 1.51%

At the same time, the yen pairs have jumped higher as traders shun safe havens. The EUR/JPY is up 2.4%, but the AUD/JPY is up 1.33% and other yen pairs up by a similar margin. 

The US dollar index gapped lower at the open as money floods into the euro, but is making gains from there


## Coming up today

Coming up today, we have German Ifo business climate at 08.00. 

This is followed by Canadian wholesale sales at 12.30. 

FOMC member Kashkari speaks at 15.30 and 19.15.


## Trade Idea

The EUR/USD has jumped higher, but there is plenty of time for 2nd round polls to twist and turn. There's a good chance that the EUR/USD could be lower on the even of the 2nd round of elections.
