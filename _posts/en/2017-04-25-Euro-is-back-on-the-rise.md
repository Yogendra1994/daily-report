## Morning Report: 07.00 London

This morning, the euro is back on the rise after after a huge gap opening higher yesterday on the Presidential election results. The likes of the EUR/USD saw a minor pullback yesterday, but the bullish trade is back in force this morning. 

The yen pairs are back on the rise, helped by investors shunning safe havens and embracing risk. 

The Australian dollar is on the rise, but the NZD/USD is struggling.

After rallying on the risk-off trade last week, gold continues to retreat. 


## Coming up today

Coming up today, we have UK public sector net borrowing at 09.30

This is followed by US CB consumer confidence at 15.00 and new home sales at the same time.


## Trade Idea

After leaping higher yesterday, the EUR/USD is once again on the rise this morning. 

However, there is still an outside chance of a pullback before next weekend's final round of elections.
