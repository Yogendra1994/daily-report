## Morning Report: 07.00 London

This morning, the yen pairs are extending their gains as investors embrace risk with US markets breaching new highs. 

The US dollar index is up slightly as US companies report positive gains. 

Elsewhere, the euro continues to make waves, with the EUR/JPY up over 4% on the week. 

The Australian and New Zealand dollar are lagging though, with the NZD/USD down 0.37%. This comes after Australian CPI missed expectations.


## Coming up today

Coming up today, we have Canadian retail sales at 12.30. 

At 14.30, we have crude oil inventories.


## Trade Idea

The Australian dollar is struggling this morning, while the dollar pushes higher. 

The AUD/USD has been testing the lows over the last month and if these break, we could see a sustained change lower.
