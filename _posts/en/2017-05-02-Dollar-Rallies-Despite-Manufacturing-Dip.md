## Morning Report: 07.00 London

This morning, the dollar index is on the rise despite yesterday's below par US manufacturing PMI. This has been followed by poor manufacturing data from China this morning.

The dollar pairs are mixed, with the the AUD/USD lower after the RBA meeting in which rates were left on hold. By contrast the EUR/USD is back on the rise while the GBP/USD sinks to losses for the second day in a row. 

The yen pairs have a firm positive bias, with the EUR/JPY leading the way. 

The euro appears to have recovered its poise this morning, with the EUR/ GBP back on the rise despite negative reports from the weekend's meeting between May and Junker.


## Coming up today

Coming up today, we have UK manufacturing PMI at 09.30 preceded by Spanish manufacturing PMI at 08.15. 


## Trade Idea

The USD/JPY appears to be picking up momentum and this could well continue. More than other pairs, the USD/ JPY's trends can run and run.
