## Morning Report: 07.00 London

This morning, the US dollar is on the rise ahead of today's ADP payroll data. Numbers are expected to dip, but perhaps more importantly, manufacturing numbers are expected to rise. 

Meanwhile, the USD/JPY and other yen pairs are generally positive, with the exception of the AUD/JPY. 

The AUD/USD is struggling after three days of solid gains.


## Coming up today

Coming up today, we have German unemployment change at 07.55

Following this, we get UK construction PMI at 08.30. 

At 12.15, we get ADP non farm employment change.

This is followed by ISM non manufacturing PMI at 14.00, followed by crude oil inventories at 14.30. 

At 18.00, we get the FOMC statement. 


## Trade Idea

The USD/CAD's rise has been remarkably consistent recently, helped by the renewed slump in oil prices. 

This won't go on forever, but there could be some upside left in this trend.
