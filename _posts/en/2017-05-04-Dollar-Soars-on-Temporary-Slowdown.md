## Morning Report: 07.00 London

The dollar is flying high this morning after last night's FOMC meeting which labelled the recent US slowdown as "temporary". The dollar index shot higher and is holding those gains this morning. 

The USD/JPY and other yen pairs followed the dollar's lead, extending the recent strong run. 

The dollar pairs fell back, but the EUR/USD is rising again this morning. 

The AUD/USD in particular has been hit hard, with heavy selling yesterday and this morning on the back of poor trade balance figures. The NZD/USD is lower in sympathy. 

Gold has also been struggling in the face of dollar strength.


## Coming up today

Coming up today, we have UK services PMI at 09.30, released alongside net lending to individuals.

At 13.30, we get Canadian trade balance, released alongside US unemployment claims, trade balance and factory orders. 

ECB President Draghi speaks at 17.30, with BOC governor Poloz speaking at 21.25.


## Trade Idea

Gold and other dollar pairs are set to struggle as the dollar ride gets back on track. If Friday's jobs numbers come in at least as expected, we could see further downside.
