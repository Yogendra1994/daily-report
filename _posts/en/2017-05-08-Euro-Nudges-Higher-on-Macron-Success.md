## Morning Report: 07.00 London

This morning, the euro has nudged higher after the election of Emmanuel Macron in France. The euro is generally higher, but gains have been measured due to the result already being priced in. 

Elsewhere, the US dollar index gapped higher, but is drifting lower after losses on Friday. 

The USD/JPY has a slight positive edge, while the GBP/JPY looks set to continue its winning run. 

Meanwhile, the USD/CAD is slipping lower again after the recovery in oil prices. 


## Coming up today
