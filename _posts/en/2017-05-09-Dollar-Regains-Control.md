## Morning Report: 07.00 London

The US dollar index has made further gains this morning, helping to put pressure on the dollar pairs. 

The AUD/USD has been the biggest seller, with the AUD/USD down 0.84% on the week. The NZD/USD is following suit. 

The EUR/USD has fallen from the highs post Macron election, while the GBP/USD is holding firm. The EUR/GBP is lower again. 

Meanwhile, commodities are slipping lower, with oil on the back foot again and gold extending its down trend. 


## Coming up today

Coming up today, we have the Australian Annual Budget Release at 09.30. 

At 14.00, we have US JOLTS job openings. 

FOMC member Kaplan speaks at 20.15.


## Trade Idea

The EUR/GBP has been trickling lower since Monday and this could well continue as the Macron trade undwinds.
