## Morning Report: 07.00 London

This morning, the British pound remains relatively strong ahead of today's MPC meeting where no change is expected. The GBP/JPY is off the highs, but the up trend remains largely in place. 

The USD/JPY and US dollar index are both slipping back after strong performances this week. 

The NZD/USD remains weak after the RBNZ's decision to keep rates unchanged, with a dovish forward outlook. 

The USD/CAD's uptrend is getting back on track, helped by the renewed weakness in oil prices.


## Coming up today

Coming up today, we have UK manufacturing production at 08.30, released alongside Goods trade balance. 

At 09.00, we get EU Economic Forecasts.

FOMC member Dudley speaks at 10.25. 

The big item is the MPC bank rate and monetary policy summary at 11.00. The BOE inflation report is released at the same time. 

At 12.30, we get US PPI and unemployment claims.


## Trade Idea

The NZD/USD's downtrend has mirrored the AUD/USD, though has gone somewhat under the radar. 

There could be further downside from here, especially as the commodity retreat continues.
