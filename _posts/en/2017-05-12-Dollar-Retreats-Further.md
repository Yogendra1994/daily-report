## Morning Report: 07.00 London

This morning, the US dollar and Japanese yen are on the back foot and extending yesterday's losses. This comes despite better than expected unemployment data from the US yesterday. 

As a consequence, the dollar pairs have enjoyed gains these last two days. The EUR/USD has still lagged though and is hardly making high while the sun shines as the dollar weakens. 

The yen pairs are following the same trend, with reversals yesterday. The GBP/JPY in particular finally posted a negative session for the first time in weeks. 

The Aussie and New Zealand dollars are also enjoying the benign conditions, with the NZD/USD halting its decline.


## Coming up today

Coming up today, we have US CPI and retail sales data at 12.30. 

FOMC member Evans speaks at 13.00. 

At 14.00, we have US UoM consumer sentiment.

FOMC member Harker speaks at 16.30.


## Trade Idea

The GBP/JPY's reversal yesterday was driven by a softening in the Bank of England's economic projections. 

This may be cause for concern, but the real driver of all the GBP/JPY recently has been the general out performance of yen pairs. This trend appears largely intact, so betting on further GBP/JPY upside could pay off.
