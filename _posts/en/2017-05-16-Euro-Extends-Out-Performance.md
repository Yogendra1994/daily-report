## Morning Report: 07.00 London

This morning, the euro has continued its 'Macron Bounce' with a third straight day of gains for the EUR/USD. The EUR/GBP is also rising, helped by the euro's out performance.

The US dollar remains under pressure, dropping the fourth day in a row.

The USD/JPY and other yen pairs are slipping lower, fuelled by the dollar's weakness. 

Dollar pairs are generally higher, with the AUD/USD recovering some more of the big losses earlier in the month.


## Coming up today

Coming up today, we have UK CPI at 08.30, released alongside RPI and PPI input. 

At 09.00, we gave European Flash GDP and German ZEW economic sentiment. 

US building permits follow at 12.30, alongside housing starts. 

At 13.15, we get US capacity utilisation rate and industrial production.

US mortgage delinquencies follow at 14.00.


## Trade Idea

The EUR/JPY is slipping back this morning, but the euro remains the currency in demand. 

The Medium term recorvery remains in place, making the EUR/JPY attractive for upside bets.
