## Morning Report: 07.00 London

This morning, the US dollar is slipping back a little after recovering yesterday on the back of jobless claims dropping to their lowest level for 28 years. Despite recent dollar weakness, analysts are still expecting the Fed to hike rates in June.

Elsewhere, the USD/JPY is following suit, with the USD/JPY falling back following strong gains yesterday. 

Other yen pairs are following this trend, though the EUR/JPY is still catching up on yesterday's under-performance.

The EUR/GBP came in for some volatile trading yesterday, settling on moderate losses. 

Meanwhile gold his steady after a hefty reversal yesterday.

## Coming up today

Coming up today, we have Canadian CPI and core retail sales at 12.30, released alongside retail sales.

## Trade Idea

Despite Brexit and election uncertainty, the pound has performed relatively well in 2017. There is still a lot of catching up to do following a poor 2016, but the current trend is worth noting. 

By contrast, the Australian dollar has under-performed as China's economy steps off the gas.
