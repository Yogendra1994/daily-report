## Morning Report: 07.00 London

This morning, the euro is extending its gains from last week, as the Macron bounce continues. The EUR/GBP is nudging higher again, with the EUR/USD holding last week's gains despite shallow selling this morning. 

The US dollar index and USD/JPY are up slightly this morning after hefty selling in the early part of last week. 

The Australian dollar is under-performing, with the AUD/USD gapping lower. The NZD/USD is powering higher however. 

The USD/CAD continues to drop, helped by the recovery in oil prices.

## Coming up today

Today, we have FOMC member Harker speaking at 14.00. Member Kashkari speaks at 14.30. 

RBA assistant governor Debelle speaks at 17.30. 

UK Prime Minister May speaks at 18.00. 

FOMC member Brainard speaks at 23.00. 

## Trade Idea

The EUR/GBP has performed well recently and this could continue as the UK general election continues to act as a drag.
