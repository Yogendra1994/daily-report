## Morning Report: 07.00 London

The pound is on the defensive after the terror attack in Manchester last night. The EUR/GBP rose last night as news of the attack filtered through. 

Elsewhere, the euro is on the back foot this morning after gains last night. 

Meanwhile, the Australian and New Zealand dollars are out-performing as hopes for the regional economy rises. 

Gold rose last night but is slipping back again this morning. 

## Coming up today

Today, we have German Ifo Business climate, flash manufacturing PMI and flash services PMI. 

At 08.30, we get the latest UK public sector net borrowing figures, with the latest inflation report hearings at 09.00. 

Canadian Wholsale sales follow at 12.30. 

FOMC member Kashkari speaks at 13.00. 

US new home sales follow at 14.00. 

FOMC members Kashkari and Harker speaker at 19.00 and 21.00 respectively. 

## Trade Idea

The Australian dollar is putting a strong run together and with the US dollar continuing to struggle, there could be further upside from here.
