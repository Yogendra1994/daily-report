## Morning Report: 07.00 London

The Australian dollar and the New Zealand dollars are on the back foot this morning after credit agencies downgraded China's rating. With its strong reliance on China, it doesn't take much for the Australian dollar to catch a Chinese cold.

Elsewhere, the US dollar is rising after a moderately positive reaction to Trump's budget. 

The euro and pound are on the back foot. 

The EUR/GBP is on the back foot as the euro continues to under-perform despite strong German Ifo business climate data yesterday. 

## Coming up today

Today, we have ECB President speaking at 12.45. 

At 14.00, we have the BOC rate statement. US existing home sales are released at the same time. 

Crude oil inventories follow at 14.30. 

At 18.00, we have the FOMC meeting minutes. FOMC member Kaplan speaks at 22.00. 

## Trade Idea

The USD/CAD has rallied for the last two days, but if Trump's plans to sell off a portion of US oil could be scuppered by opposition as much of his budget may be. We could see further downside from here as the USD/CAD downside continues.
