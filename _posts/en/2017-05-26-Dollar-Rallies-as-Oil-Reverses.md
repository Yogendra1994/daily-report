title: "May 26th: Dollar Rallies as Oil Reverses"

## Morning Report: 07.00 London

OPEC agreed to cut oil production yesterday, but by lesser amount than expected, causing crude prices to suffer their biggest one day fall of 2017. The move had a knock on effect on the US dollar, helping it to rally against other majors. 

The USD/CAD saw the biggest moves, with the USD/CAD rallying. The US dollar rallied as the Canadian dollar slipped lower. 

The GBP/USD has under performed other struggling dollar pairs after GDP estimates dropped below expectation yesterday. The EUR/GBP extended its rally as a result. 

The yen pairs are generally lower, but the GBP/JPY has seen the steepest declines, down 0.81% this morning. 

## Coming up today

Today we have G7 meetings running throughout the day. 

At 13.30, we get US core durable goods orders, released alongside preliminary GDP. 

At 15.00, we get revised US UoM consumer sentiment. 

## Trade Idea

The EUR/GBP has been rallying since early May, with the 0.8800 levels now a realistic target. 

The pound is likely to remain depressed until the General Election outcome, which could mean further upside for the EUR/GBP.
