## Morning Report: 07.00 London

This morning, the pound is steadier than expected after a poll published in the Times but the UK general election as being closer than previously expected. There was strong interest for the pound yesterday however, with the EUR/GBP reversing Monday's gain. 

The dollar is marginally higher this morning, but not by enough to break the trends of the last week or so, especially on the USD/JPY which remains firmly in a down trend. 

The NZD/USD is now unchanged after reaching higher levels earlier in the session. The Aussie has a small negative bias. 

Gold is now off for the third day in a row.

## Coming up today

This morning, we have UK net lending to individuals at 09.30. 

European CPI flash estimate follows at 10.00. 

FOMC member Kaplan speaks at 13.00. 

At 13.30, we get Canadian GDP. 

US Chicago PMI follows at 14.45, with pending home sales at 15.00. 

## Trade Idea

Political bookmakers are still inferring an 80% chance of a conservative victory in the forthcoming general election, but this is down from around 95% just weeks ago. 

Recent polls have put the election as potentially closer than previously thought, but Conservative government of sorts is still the most likely scenario, but a lower mandate may disappoint markets.
