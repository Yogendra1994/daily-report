## Morning Report: 07.00 London

This morning, the US dollar pairs are mixed ahead of the big job numbers later today. Analysts are expecting a number around 180k to be added. 

The GBP/USD has slipped lower, while most other dollar pairs are enjoying small gains. 

Bigger movements are being seen on the yen pairs, with all major pairs trading higher, especially the AUD/JPY which is looking to reverse a week of losses. 

Gold is trading lower for the second day in a row, capping a range bound week. 

## Coming up today

We start the day with UK Construction PMI at 09.30. 

The main events are at 13.30, with Canadian and US trade balance data. 

At the same time, we get US non farm payrolls, released alongside the average earnings data and the unemployment rate. 

## Trade Idea

The New Zealand dollar has been in a moderate uptrend for the last 30 days and this is often ignored as the AUD/USD leads the way.
