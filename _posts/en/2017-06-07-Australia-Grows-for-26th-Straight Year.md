## Morning Report: 07.00 London

This morning, the Australian dollar remains one of the strongest currencies, with the AUD/JPY and AUD/USD up around 0.40%. This follows the latest GDP figures which showed that the Australian economy has posted 103 consecutive quarters of growth.

The dollar is lower again this morning, though dollar pairs are mixed with the GBP/USD up slightly and the EUR/USD down slightly. 

The USD/JPY is slipping lower again however, following yesterday's heavy selling. 

Gold is on the back foot today after pushing through the $1290 level yesterday. 

## Coming up today

Coming up today, we have UK Halifax HPI at 08.30.

At 13.30, we get Canadian Building Permits. 

Crude oui inventories follow at 15.30. 

## Trade Idea

Gold has performed exceptionally well of late, charging right into the $1290-$1300 levels 

Gold has performed poorly recently at these levels though, so a pull back could be on the cards.
