This morning, the Australian dollar is holding firm despite below expectation Australian and Chinese trade balance data in the early hours of this morning. 

The New Zealand dollar is continuing to push higher, with further gains so far today. 

Dollar pairs are generally nudging higher, while the dollar index slips again.

Yen pairs are on the back foot again, led by the GBP/JPY which is the worst performing pair so far this morning. 

## Coming up today

It is polling day in the UK elections today, so expect fluctuations in the pound as the exit poll data comes in. 

At 12.45, we have the minimum bid rate from the ECB, followed by the press conference at 13.30. 

US unemployment claims are also released at 13.30. 

BOC governor Poloz speaks at 16.15. 

## Trade Idea

The Corbyn surge has taken many by surprise in the UK election, but judging by various polls and betting markets, it is unlikely to be enough to stop a conservative majority.
