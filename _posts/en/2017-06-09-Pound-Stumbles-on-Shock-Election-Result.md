## Morning Report: 07.00 London

The British pound is making a tentative recovery this morning, following Friday's marginally positive session as markets adjust to the prospect of a Conservative minority government. 

Dollar pairs are generally positive this morning, with the GBP/USD one of the top performing currencies in a slow morning. The NZD/USD is lagging however, reversing a small amount of last week's gains. 

The yen pairs are mixed though, with the USD/JPY slipping lower, the EUR/JPY unchanged and GBP/JPY slightly higher. 

Gold is extending its negative run however, as the precious metal continues to slip from recent highs.

## Coming up today

It's a quiet day today, with RBA assistant governor Debelle the main item in the morning. 

## Trade Idea

The GBP/JPY made gains on Friday and small moves higher today so far. Regardless of election results, the pair has been in a firm down trend. 

A new government is being formed, but negative ruminations could continue for weeks.
