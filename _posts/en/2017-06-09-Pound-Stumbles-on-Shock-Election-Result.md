## Morning Report: 07.00 London

This morning, the pound is reeling after the shock election result, which currently points to a hung parliament. At the time of writing, it is still unclear what form the next government will take, but the unexpected result has rankled markets. The EUR/GBP is up 1.87%, with the GBP/USD down 1.83%. 

The US dollar is on the rise as investors show a preference for safe havens. Most dollar pairs with the exception of the GBP/USD are on the rise this morning though, after heavy losses yesterday. 

The yen pairs are on the rise, with the exception of the GBP/JPY.

Meanwhile, gold has continued to retreat from the highs, posting its third loss in a row.

## Coming up today

Coming up today, we have UK manufacturing production at 09.30, released alongside goods trade balance. 

At 13.30, we have the Canadian employment change and unemployment rate data. 

## Trade Idea

with the UK at the epicentre of political uncertainty, it may be worth looking at somewhere as far away as possible. 

In these light, the NZD/USD appears to be a bastion of calm with a consistent up trend over the last few weeks.
