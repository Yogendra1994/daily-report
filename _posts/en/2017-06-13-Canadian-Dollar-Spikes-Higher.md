## Morning Report: 07.00 London

This morning, the Canadian dollar continues to out-perform after spiking higher yesterday on the back of interest rate hike talk from BOC officials. 

Meanwhile, the dollar pairs continue to perform well, with the GBP/USD up higher, with the NZD/ USD and AUD/USD holding at the highs. 

The euro is lagging however, with the EUR/GBP slipping lower. 

The yen pairs are nudging higher, led by the AUD/JPY.

## Coming up today

Coming up today, we have UK CPI at 09.30, released alongside PPI and RPI. 

At 10.00, we get German ZEW economic sentiment. 

Then at 13.30, we have US PPI data. 

## Trade Idea

The UK looks set for at least weeks if not months of continued uncertainty as the Brexit strategy looks set to be re-written.

By contrast, the Australian economy continues to expand, putting renewed pressure on the GBP/AUD.
