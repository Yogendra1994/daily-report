## Morning Report: 07.00 London

Despite the prospect of a US rate hike today, the US dollar index is heading lower and threatening the June lows. Analysts are widely expecting a rate hike of 0.25%, but this much has been priced in for a number of months. The key now is how fast rates into the future. Given recent market uncertainly, there are indications that today's hike could be the lead to a significant pause. 

The dollar pairs are enjoying the Greenback's weakness, with the AUD/USD leading the group and the NZD/USD not far behind. 

The pound remains strong after yesterday's bigger than expected inflation which saw CPI, RPI and HPI rise more than expected. The GBP/JPY has been a surpise winner, with the EUR/GBP slipping lower again. 

The USD/CAD has continued to slide lower as the 'Loonie' out performs. 

Gold is up for the second day, but still well below recent highs. 

## Coming up today

We have a busy day today, starting with UK average earnings index, claimant count change and unemployment rate at 09.30. 

At 13.30, we get US CPI and retail sales. 

Crude oil inventories are released at 15.30. 

At 19.00, we get the main item - the FOMC statement and economic projections. The press conference follows at 19.30 

## Trade Idea

The AUD/USD continues to benefit from benign Chinese trading conditions, especially after strong data from the region this morning. 

As markets turn the screw on the dollar, there could be further upside for the AUD/USD.
