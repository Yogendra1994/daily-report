## Morning Report: 07.00 London

This morning, the euro and other dollar pairs are trading higher as the dollar softens.

The euro is slightly higher against the pound this so far this morning after selling off yesterday as Brexit talks began. 

The yen pairs have a negative bias, led by the USD/JPY which is trading lower. 

The New Zealand dollar is once again leading dollar pairs higher. 

Gold remains soft however. 

## Coming up today

Coming up today, we have the Mansion House speech from BOE Governor Carney and Chancellor Hammond. 

SNB Chairman Jordan speaks at 09.45.

Canadian Wholesale sales are released at 13.30, alongside US current account. 

## Trade Idea

The NZD/USD has been one of the more consistent performers of late and this could translate into higher levels in coming weeks.
