## Morning Report: 07.00 London

This morning, the pound remains under pressure after dropping yesterday heavily yesterday on Mark Carney's Dovish talk on interest rates. The EUR/GBP is now up over 1% on the week. 

The dollar pairs are generally on the back foot, with the AUD/USD in particular dropping for the third day in a row. 

The yen pairs are also on the back foot, led by the GBP/JPY.

The USD/CAD is halting its decline as oil enters bear market territory. 

## Coming up today

Coming up today, we have UK public sector net borrowing at 09.30.

Following this, we get US existing home sales at 15.00. 

US crude oil inventories are released at 15.00. 

At 22.00, we get the RBZN rate statement. 

## Trade Idea

Today's Queen's speech should provide some clarity, but it also starts two years of further political uncertainty.
