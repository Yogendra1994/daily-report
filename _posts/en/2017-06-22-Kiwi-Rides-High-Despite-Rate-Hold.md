## Morning Report: 07.00 London

This morning, the NZD/USD is the top performer despite the RBNZ opting to keep rates on hold last night. 

The AUD/USD is also recovering after three days of losses. 

The yen pairs have a negative bias, with the GBP/JPY soft in particular. 

The USD/CAD is slipping back this morning as oil prices stabilise following further selling this week. 

Gold is continuing to rally though, posting gains this week. 

## Coming up today

Coming up today, we have Canadian core retail sales at 13.30, released alongside US unemployment claims. 

FOMC member Powell speaks at 15.00. 

## Trade Idea

The GBP/AUD has struggled since the UK entered the thickest part of the general election. 

The news is hardly likely to be trouble free in coming weeks though as the Conservative minority government presses on with Brexit. Meanwhile, the Australian dollar continues to hold steady.
