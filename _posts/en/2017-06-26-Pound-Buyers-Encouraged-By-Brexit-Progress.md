## Morning Report: 07.00 London

The British pound is out-performing this morning after another positive reaction to May's Brexit concessions. The EUR/GBP has gapped lower, with the GBP/USD gapping higher. 

Other dollar pairs are mixed, with the EUR/USD falling back from its opening jump, but the AUD/USD posting early gains. 

The yen pairs have a positive bias, led by the GBP/JPY and AUD/JPY. 

Gold is slipping back after four days of consecutive gains last week. 

## Coming up today

Coming up today, we have core durable goods orders at 13.30.

At 18.30, we get ECB President Draghi speaking.

## Trade Idea

Silver made an attempted recovery last week, but it looks as though the down trend could be setting back in again.
