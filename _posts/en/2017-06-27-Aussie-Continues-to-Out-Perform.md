The NZD/USD is following suit, extending its medium term trend. 

The euro has a positive bias so far this morning, with the EUR/GBP making gains, while the GBP/USD is unchanged so far this morning. 

The yen is performing well, with the USD/JPY and other yen pairs struggling with the exception of the AUD/JPY.
