## Morning Report: 07.00 London

The US dollar continues to retreat this morning after suffering heavy selling yesterday. The main dollar pairs saw broad based buying yesterday, while most are at least holding those gains this morning. The moves came as the IMF warned of slower global growth the the US government's failure to pass reforms cited as a concern. 

The euro saw large gains, with the EUR/USD and EUR/JPY jumping higher yesterday as Mario Draghi painted a positive picture for eurozone growth. 

The pound also had a positive session, though lagging the euro, helping the EUR/GBP to make gains. 

The Australian dollar is testing the highs again after a former RBA member indicated that there could be a series of rate hikes ahead. 

The USD/CAD joined the party, with the Canadian dollar benefitting from stronger oil prices.
