## Morning Report: 07.00 London

Major currency pairs are settling this morning after a volatile sessions yesterday sparked by market reactions to central bank heads yesterday. The likes of Mario Draghi were outlining how they would removed themselves from record stimulus levels, with varying degrees of success judging by market reactions. The pound jumped higher, while the euro ended the day positive after much up and down action. 

The GBP/USD is leading currencies higher after monster gains yesterday, while the AUD/USD is enjoying time at the highs. The EUR/USD is inline with other pairs after yesterday's lag. 

The yen pairs are generally positive, though the USD/JPY is lagging behind. 

## Coming up today

Coming up today, we have UK net lending to individuals. 

This is followed by final US GDP at 14.00, released alongside US unemployment claims. 

## Trade Idea

The Aussie really has the bit between its teeth at the moment and this could mean further upside from here.
