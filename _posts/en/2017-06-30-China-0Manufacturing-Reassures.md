## Morning Report: 07.00 London

Bond markets are showing signs of stress, but currencies have been reassured this morning by the latest manufacturing numbers from China. The US dollar is making gains this morning as investors eye safe havens after losses yesterday. 

The EUR/USD is seeing losses this morning, while the GBP/USD is unchanged, with the AUD/USD making gains. 

The yen pairs are showing similar trends, with the USD/JPY down slightly again. Most yen pairs are showing small losses so far today. 

Meanwhile, the USD/CAD is continuing its strong down trend despite the ongoing weakness in the price of oil. 

## Coming up today

Coming up today, we have UK current account data at 09.30, released alongside final GDP. 

At 10.00, we have European CPI flash estimate. 

From 13.30, we switch to North America, for Canadian GDP and RMPI as well as US core PCE price index and personal spending. 

At 14.45, we get Chicago PMI, followed by revised UoM consumer sentiment.

## Trade Idea

This morning, the EUR/USD is pulling back slightly, but the longer term trend remains positive. 

The US dollar continues to back off, which could point to further EUR/USD upside from here.
