## Morning Report: 07.00 London

This morning, the US dollar is recovering, forcing dollar pairs lower this morning. All major dollar pairs are on the back foot, with the NZD/USD slightly out pacing other pairs, down 0.29%.

The EUR/GBP remains on the back foot with the EUR/GBP trading down for third day out of four. 

The yen pairs by contrast are on the up, after Japanese Tankan Manufacturing Index came in above expectations. The USD/JPY is up 0.22%, with other yen pairs following suit. 

Gold remains on the defensive as the dollar shows signs of strength. 

## Coming up today

Coming up today, we have Spanish Manufacturing PMI at 08.15. 

At 09.30, we get UK manufacturing PMI. 

At 15.00, we get ISM manufacturing PMI. 

It is Canadian bank holiday today in honour of Canada day.

## Trade Idea

As the yen pairs advance, the AUD/JPY is keeping the momentum up at the top.
