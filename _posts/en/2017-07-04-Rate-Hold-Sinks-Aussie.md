## Morning Report: 07.00 London

The Australian dollar is selling off heavily this morning after the RBA opted to put rates on hold. This and the accompanying statement slashed expectations for rate hikes in coming months, sending the AUD/USD and AUD/JPY tumbling. 

The dollar pairs are also struggling, with the likes of the GBP/USD and EUR/USD on the back foot as the US dollar regains control. 

The yen pairs are dancing to the same tune, with the USD/JPY slipping lower. 

Gold and silver continue to struggle in the face of the dollar's renewed strength.

## Trade Idea

The Canadian dollar is on the back foot this morning, but has been performing very well since the start of May despite weakness in the price of oil. In the last few weeks, this move has also coincided with the renewed confidence in the price of oil, so crucial to the Canadian economy. 

This could lead to further downside for the USD/CAD over coming weeks.
