## Morning Report: 07.00 London

This morning, the British pound remains under pressure after construction PMI dropped slightly below expectations yesterday. The EUR/GBP is rising this morning, with the GBP/USD down for a third straight day in a row. 

The US dollar is on the rise again this morning after markets closed for Independence Day. 

Other dollar pairs are mixed, with the EUR/ USD trading lower, but the AUD/USD back on the rise. 

The yen pairs are rising again, with the USD/JPY undoing yesterday's losses. 

## Coming up today

Coming up today, we have UK services PMI at 09.30. 

At 15.00, we have US factory orders, with FOMC meeting minutes at 19.00. 

## Trade Idea

The USD/JPY remains on a strong trend since the middle of June, with lots of room for further gains.
