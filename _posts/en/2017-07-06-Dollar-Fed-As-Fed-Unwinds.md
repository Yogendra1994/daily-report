## Morning Report: 07.00 London

This morning, the dollar remains strong as the latest Fed minutes showed that policymakers were ready to press ahead with the unwinding of stimulus packages. 

The Australian dollar remains on the back foot, alongside the euro, but the pound is strong this morning, helping the GBP/USD to rise. 

The EUR/GBP is falling as the euro loses ground to the out-performing pound. 

The USD/CAD has risen as oil prices slump overnight. 

The yen pairs are mixed, with most on the slide, but the GBP/JPY rising. 

## Coming up today

Today, we have US ADP non-farm employment change at 13.15. 

At 13.30, we get Canadian and US trade balance figures, released alongside US unemployment claims. 

At 15.00, we have US ISM non manufacturing PMI, with FOMC member Powell speaking.

US Crude oil inventories follow at 16.00  

## Trade Idea

The late June spurt is starting to unwind for the EUR/USD but there could be further to fall.
