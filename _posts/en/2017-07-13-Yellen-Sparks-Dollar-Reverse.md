## Morning Report: 07.00 London

The dollar is under pressure again this morning following Fed chair Janet Yellen's testimony which seemed to question inevitability of further steady rate hikes.

Dollar pairs are generally higher, with the exception of the euro which is lagging, with the EUR/GBP also falling short. 

The AUD/USD is powering higher however, with the NZD/USD following in its slipstream. 

## Coming up today

Coming up today, we have US PPI and unemployment claims at 13.30. 

Fed Chair Yellen testifies at 15.00. 

## Trade Idea

The dollar weakness is hitting Canadian dollar strength, driving the USD/ CAD lower.
