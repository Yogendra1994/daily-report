## Morning Report: 07.00 London

This morning, the Australian dollar remains the top performer, with the AUD/JPY rising another 0.29%. The AUD/USD is up 1.88% on the week, with the AUD/JPY up 1.41%. 

Despite positive comments from Janet Yellen overnight, the dollar index has continued to fall to its lowest levels of the month. 

The euro remains weak, with the EUR/GBP dropping for the third day in a row. The EUR/USD has also struggled these last three days while other dollar pairs have flourished. 

The GBP/USD is rising again and is close to erasing Monday's losses. 

## Coming up today

Coming up today, we have US CPI and retail sales data at 13.30. 

At 14.15, we get US Capacity Utilisation Rate, released alongside US industrial production. 

FOMC member Kaplan speaks at 14.30.

At 15.00, we get preliminary UoM consumer sentiment.
