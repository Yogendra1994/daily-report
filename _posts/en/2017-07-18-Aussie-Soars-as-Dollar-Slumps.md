## Morning Report: 07.00 London

This morning, the dollar index is slipping again, mainly as a counter-reaction to the surging Australian dollar. 

The Australian dollar is soaring this morning, as the RBA took an optimistic view on the economy, pointing to the potential for rates to hit 3.5%. The AUD/USD is up 1.4%, with the AUD/JPY up nearly 1%. 

The EUR/USD and GBP/USD are both on the rise, with the EUR/ GBP making further gains as the euro out performs. 

After a brief rally yesterday, the USD/CAD is back on the slide again this morning. 

## Coming up today

We start the day with UK CPI, RPI and PPI at 09.30. 

At 10.00, we get German ZEW economic sentiment. 

Import prices follow at 13.30. 

BOE governor Carney speaks at 14.30. 

## Trade Idea

We've been a backer of the AUD/USD in recent months and despite today's rise, there are grounds for further optimism.
