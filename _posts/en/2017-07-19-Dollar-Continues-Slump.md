## Morning Report: 07.00 London

This morning, the US dollar has continued its descent, helping to keep a positive bias for most dollar pairs. 

The Australian dollar is continuing its fine run, with more gains made this morning. 

The pound is performing better this morning after a poor performance yesterday on the back of lower than expected inflation numbers. 

The euro is softer after out-performing yesterday. 

## Coming up today

Coming up today, we have Canadian Manufacturing Sales at 13.30. 

At the same time, we get US building permits and housing starts. 

US crude oil inventories follow at 15.30. 

## Trade Idea

The Australian dollar keeps on trucking at the moment, and with the yen not offering much resistance at the moment, there could be more upside from here.
