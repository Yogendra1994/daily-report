## Morning Report: 07.00 London

Tech stocks hit record highs last night and the US dollar has halted its slump this morning. 

The USD/JPY is matching the US dollar index, making gains this morning, reversing yesterday's gains. This despite in-line employment data. 

Elsewhere, the Australian dollar is giving back some of its recent gains, with the AUD/ USD and AUD/JPY slipping. 

The euro and pound are trading lower, though the EUR/GBP is slipping as the euro lags. 

## Coming up today

Today, we have UK retail sales at 09.30. 

This is followed by the ECB bid rate at 12.45. The ECB press conference follows at 13.30. 

Also at 13.30, we get US unemployment claims and the Philly Fed Manufacturing Index. 

## Trade Idea

The USD/CAD has made steady losses in recent weeks, helped by the oil prices making a sustained push since the beginning of the month. 

With the US dollar still weak, there could be further downside for the USD/CAD.
