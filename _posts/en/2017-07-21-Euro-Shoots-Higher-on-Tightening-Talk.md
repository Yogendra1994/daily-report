## Morning Report: 07.00 London

This morning, the euro is holding yesterday's gains after ECB chair Mario Draghi outlined plans that have been seen as the start of the tightening phase. 

The EUR/GBP remains at the highs as the pound struggles amid Brexit negotiation blockages. 

Meanwhile, the Australian dollar has come off the highs, with the AUD/USD one of the big losers this morning. 

The NZD/USD is storming higher by contrast. 

The USD/JPY is slipping lower again as the yen regains regional control. 

## Coming up today

This morning, we have UK public sector net borrowing at 09.30. 

We have a Canadian focus at 13.30 with CPI and retail sales. 

## Trade Idea

The euro is storming higher on the back of ECB tightening comments, but this merely extends the recent trend that has been running throughout 2017. 

The weak dollar has played a part here, but the gains have accelerated since Macron's election.
