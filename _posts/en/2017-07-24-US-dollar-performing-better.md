## Morning Report: 07.00 London

This morning, the US dollar is performing better despite the latest report continuing to predict moderate global growth as Trumps plans remain stalled. 

The USD/JPY is rallying, while other yen pairs retain a positive bias. 

Meanwhile the dollar pairs opened higher generally but have pushed back to close the opening gap higher. 

The EUR/GBP is holding most of last week's gains, with minor losses so far. 

## Coming up today

Coming up today, we a series of European flash manufacturing PMI and flash services PMI, starting with French data at 08.00, followed by German data at 08.30 and pan European at 09.00. 

At 13.30, we get Canadian wholesale sales. 

US existing home sales follow at 15.00. 

## Trade Idea

The USD/CAD continues to trend lower as the US dollar drifts in the face of a drip drip of disappointment on Trump's economic record.
