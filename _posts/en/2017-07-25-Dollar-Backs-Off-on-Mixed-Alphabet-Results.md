## Morning Report: 07.00 London

The dollar pairs are on the rise this morning as the dollar backs off after last night's mixed results from Alphabet, Google's parent company. The AUD/USD is leading the back, up 0.23%, with the EUR/USD following close by, up 0.21%.

The dollar has resumed its slump, with the USD/JPY slipping lower and below Monday's open. 

Yesterday's recovery in oil prices has helped the USD/CAD to resume its steady decline. 

After a strong reversal yesterday, the EUR/GBP is back on the rise this morning. 

## Coming up today

Coming up today, we have German Ifo business climate at 09.00. 

At 15.00, we get CB Consumer confidence. 

MPC member Haldane speaks at 18.00.

## Trade Idea

The AUD/USD has taken a much needed pause lately, but the hot trending pair looks set for more upside from here.
