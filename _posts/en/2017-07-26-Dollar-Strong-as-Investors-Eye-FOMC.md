## Morning Report: 07.00 London

This morning, the US dollar performing well again as investors eye tonight's FOMC meeting. No change is expected, but hints as to the future direction of travel will be a market mover as ever. 

Dollar pairs are on the back foot, with the AUD/ USD down by 0.66% as inflation drops more than expected. 

The EUR/USD is slipping lower despite Greece returning to debt markets.

Yen pairs are on the back foot after two days of gains.

Gold is slipping lower, falling for the third day this week. 

## Coming up today

Coming up today, we have UK preliminary GDP at 09.30. A gain of 0.3% is expected. 

US New home sales follow at 15.00, with crude oil inventories at 15.30. 

At 19.00, we get the FOMC statement and federal funds rate. 

## Trade Idea

The New Zealand dollar has slipped back these last three days, but the trend since May has been overwhelmingly positive.
