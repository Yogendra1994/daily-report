## Morning Report: 07.00 London

Last night, the Fed opted to keep rates on hold, but more significantly signalled that they would beginning to reduce it's crisis era balance sheet as soon as September. The dollar slumped as a result, with follow-on selling this morning. 

The dollar pairs have enjoyed gains since last night, with NZD/USD and AUD/USD leading the pack over the last 24 hours. 

The euro is falling behind this morning though, with the EUR/USD flat while the likes of the GBP/USD continue to rise. 

Meanwhile the USD/CAD has continued it's steady decline.

The USD/JPY has now reversed all of Tuesday's gains as the dollar slumps and money flows to the yen. Other yep pairs remain positive, with the AUD/JPY gaining for the last four days. 

## Coming up today

Coming up today, we have the Spanish unemployment rate at 08.00, followed by European M3 money supply. 

At 13.30, we get US core durable goods orders and unemployment claims. 

## Trade Idea

The AUD/JPY has recovered from its recent impasse and is showing no signs of a significant reversal.
