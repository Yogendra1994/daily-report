## Morning Report: 07.00 London

The dollar remains on top this morning after strong gains yesterday. These gains are in part being driven by yesterday's better than expected durable goods orders.

A big mover over the last few days has been the Swiss franc which has fallen hard since Wednesday, with gains for the USD/CHF and EUR/CHF. 

The dollar pairs are mixed this morning after a wide sell-off yesterday, the GBP/USD is threatening small gains, while the EUR/USD is unchanged. 

Commodity currencies have a negative bias with the Australian and Canadian dollars.

The yen pairs are also on the back foot, with the USD/JPY on the defensive as the yen out paces the dollar. 

## Coming up today

Today we have with Swiss KOF economic barometer at 08.00. At the same time we get Spanish Flash CPI and GDP. 

At 13.30, we have US and Canadian GDP data, alongside the US unemployment cost index. 

At 15.00, we get revised UoM consumer sentiment. 

FOMC member Kashkari speaks at 18.20. 

## Trade Idea

After the brief rally, the USD/JPY has resumed its down trend with clear air until potential resistance around the lows.
