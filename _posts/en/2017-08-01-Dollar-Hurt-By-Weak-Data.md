## Morning Report: 07.00 London

This morning, the dollar index has continues its decline, fuelled by yesterday's worse than expected Chicago PMI. 

The dollar pairs are mixed this morning after solid gains yesterday which saw the EUR/USD extend its winning run. The EUR/USD is off slightly this morning though, while the GBP/USD and AUD/USD makes gains. 
 
The USD/JPY has slipped lower again, as the weak dollar meets the strong yen. 

Gold is on the rise again as it enjoys the benign dollar environment. 

## Coming up today

Coming up today, we have UK manufacturing PMI at 09.30. 

This is followed by European preliminary Flash GDP at 10.00. 

At 13.30, we get US core PCE price index, released alongside personal spending. 

At 15.00, we have US ISM manufacturing PMI. 

## Trade Idea

The euro is continuing to perform well, aided by the ongoing weakness in the US dollar.

This could well continue as the European story continues to regain confidence.
