## Morning Report: 07.00 London

The euro remains strong this morning after figures showing that GDP and business confidence were on the rise. The reaction has been relatively muted though as the EUR/GBP remains within its trading range. 

The dollar pairs are generally flat to positive, with the dollar index recovering these last two days. 

The Australian and New Zealand dollars are on the rise after hefty losses yesterday. 

The yen pairs are mirroring the dollar's rise, with the USD/JPY pushing through Monday's opening gap lower. 

## Coming up today

Coming up today, we have Spanish unemployment change at 08.00. 

At 09.30, we get construction PMI. 

Then at 13.15, we get ADP non-farm employment change. 

Crude oil inventories follow at 15.30. 

## Trade Idea

The narrative surrounding the euro is overwhelmingly positive at the moment following yesterday's data release. Risks still remain and the Greek debt crisis is largely unresolved, but it is worth riding this current trend while investor confidence remains.
