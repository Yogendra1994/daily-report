## Morning Report: 07.00 London

The US dollar is on the rise this morning, despite US ADP non farm employment change increasing less than expected. 

This is putting pressure on the dollar pairs which are flat to negative this morning. The EUR/USD and GBP/USD are seeing minor losses, while the NZD/USD and AUD/USD are experiencing more a sustained pull-back. 

The USD/CAD is on the rise for the fourth day in a row. 

The yen pairs are slipping back however, with the AUD/JPY one of the worst performers after poor trade balance data. 

## Coming up today

Coming up today, we have UK services PMI at 09.30. 

At 12.00, we get the MPC rate report, policy summary, official bank rate and inflation report. No change is expected, but the forward view will be keenly listened to in light of Brexit uncertainties. Governor Carney speaks at 12.30. 

At 13.30, we get US unemployment claims. 

This is followed by ISM non-manufacturing PMI at 15.00. 

## Trade Idea

The USD/JPY's two day rally has been a good opportunity to reload on bearish bets. The US dollar has made short term gains, but the general trend remains lower for the dollar.
