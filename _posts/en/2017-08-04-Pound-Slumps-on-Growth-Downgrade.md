## Morning Report: 07.00 London

The British Pound remains under pressure this morning despite the Bank of England warning of further rate hikes to come. The MPC downgraded growth prospects for the UK, citing Brexit uncertainty. The EUR/GBP shot higher yesterday, with other pound pairs plunging. The moves are sustaining this morning. 

The euro made gains yesterday, with the EUR/USD rallying and the EUR/JPY making small losses compared to other yen pairs. 

The yen pairs were pushed lower yesterday, as the USD/JPY led the slumped. 

The AUD/USD and NZD/USD are peeling back after recovery gains yesterday. 

## Coming up today

Coming up today at 13.30, we have US Non Farm Employment Change, alongside average earnings and the unemployment rate. 

We get Canadian employment change at the same time. 

Ivey PMI is at 15.00.

## Trade Idea

The GBP/USD slumped yesterday on MPC growth downgrades. There may well be upside from here still though as the spectre of further rate hikes remain. 

While the dollar remains weak, it could pay to bet on a return to the uptrend from here.
