## Morning Report: 07.00 London

This morning, the US dollar is slipping off the pace after a jumping higher on Friday's US jobs report. The likes of the EUR/USD are on the up after suffering heavy losses Friday. The New Zealand is lagging however. 

The yen pairs are mirroring this trend, easing back after hefty gains on Friday fuelled by the strong yen. 

The EUR/GBP is on the rise again after small losses on Friday. 

Gold is unchanged after suffering similar losses Friday.

## Coming up today

Coming up today, we have UK Halifax HPI at 08.30. 

FOMC member Kashkari speaks at 18.25. 

## Trade Idea

The Australian dollar has fallen recently as all dollar pairs felt the pinch of the US dollar's strength. 

The Aussie has held up relatively well though, falling less than other pairs and making gains against the likes of the euro and pound.

The GBP/AUD has therefore made losses the last few days and there could be more downside from here.
