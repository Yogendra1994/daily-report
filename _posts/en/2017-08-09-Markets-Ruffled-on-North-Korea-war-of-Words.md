## Morning Report: 07.00 London

This morning, markets are jittery following the escalation of tensions between North Korea and the US. 

The US dollar is on the back foot after a volatile session yesterday. 

The dollar pairs are mixed, with losses for the AUD/USD and EUR/USD and gains for the GBP/ USD and USD/CHF. The latter is moving as investors seek out safe havens. 

The yen pairs are generally lower, with the exception of the GBP/JPY which is out-performing. 

Gold is on the rise on the safe haven play

## Coming up today

Coming up today at 13.30, we have US preliminary non-farm productivity and unit labour costs. 

At 15.30, we get US crude oil inventories.

At 22.00, we get the New Zealand rate statement. 

## Trade Idea

The Swiss Franc is back in the news this morning as investors seek out the safety of the Swiss Franc, putting pressure on the USD/CHF. 

If the war of words continues, we could see further downside for the USD/CHF.
