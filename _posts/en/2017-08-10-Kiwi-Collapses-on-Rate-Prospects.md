## Morning Report: 07.00 London

This morning, the New Zealand dollar is the big mover after comments from RBNZ officials which stated that the Kiwi "does need to adjust down". The NZD/USD is down by over 1.00% so far. 

Elsewhere, the dollar pairs are slipping lower though by a lesser margin than the Kiwi. The AUD/USD is sliding again, with the GBP/USD on track to be down for five of the last six days. 

Yen pairs are following suit, with the likes of the GBP/JPY extending losing runs. 

The USD/CHF is pushing up this morning after its biggest single day move since 2015. 

Gold continues to rise this morning as investors seek out safe havens. 

## Coming up today

This morning, we have UK manufacturing production at 09.30, released alongside goods trade balance. 

At 13.30, we have US PPI, unemployment claims and NHPI. 

At 15.00, we get FOMC member Dudley speaking. 

## Trade Idea

The GBP/JPY continues to slip as Brexit fractions come to the fore. 

Now could be a good time to bet on further downside.
