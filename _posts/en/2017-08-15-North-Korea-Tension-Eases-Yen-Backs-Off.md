## Morning Report: 07.00 London

This morning, the Japanese yen is on the back foot as yen pairs dominate the early movers. The USD/ JPY is one of the top movers, with the GBP/ JPY performing well. 

The AUD/ JPY is also continuing its rebound.

The dollar is rallying, forcing dollar pairs lower. 

The USD/ CHF is rallying again, completely erasing last week's risk aversion trade.

Gold is also nudging off the highs as a further sign of the market's ease on the North Korea situation. 

## Coming up today

Coming up today we have UK CPI at 09.30, released alongside PPI and RPI. 

At 13.30, we get US core retail sales, empire state manufacturing and import prices. 

## Trade Idea

The British pound has performed well this week, but long term pressure remains despite today's planned Brexit announcement. There is a long road still ahead.
