## Morning Report: 07.00 London

This morning the Australian dollar remains the power player after the IMF predicted faster growth for China, albeit fuelled by dangerous levels of debt. Australian pairs are rallying this morning while other dollar pairs falter. 

After a below par set of inflation figures yesterday, the British pound slumped against most currencies. The EUR/GBP is on the rise as a result, extending its recent up-trend. 

The dollar pairs are generally flat to negative this morning after yesterday's better than expected Empire State Manufacturing Index and retail sales. 

The yen pairs are on the rise, led by the AUD/JPY, as the USD/JPY extends its recent rebound.

## Coming up today

Coming up today, we have UK claimant count change and unemployment rate. At the same time we get average earnings index. 

At 10.00, we get European flash GDP. 

At 13.30, we get US building permits and housing starts. Canadian securities purchases are released at the same time. 

US crude oil inventories are released at 15.30. 

At the 19.00, we get the release of the latest FOMC meeting minutes. 

## Trade Idea

The Australian dollar remains strong despite IMF warnings about dangerous debt levels. Meanwhile, the pound remains under pressure.

The GBP/AUD has had been stuck in a range recently, but recent events may force deciding move lower in coming weeks.
