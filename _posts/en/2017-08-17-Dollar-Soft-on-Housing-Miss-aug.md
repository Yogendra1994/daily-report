## Morning Report: 07.00 London

This morning, the US dollar remains soft after yesterday's below par building permits and housing starts. In addition, Fed minutes showed that policy makers were concerned about weak inflation. 

The weak dollar is helping the dollar pairs to push higher. Most are flat to positive this morning, but there were big gains yesterday, led by the AUD/USD and NZD/USD.

Elsewhere, the USD/CAD slumped lower as the US dollar stepped off the gas. 

The EUR/ GBP is flat so far today, but extended its recent winning run recently. 

## Coming up today

Coming up today, we have UK retail sales at 09.30. 

Following this we get European final CPI at 10.00. 

At 12.30, we get ECB monetary policy meeting accounts. 

We switch to North America at 13.30 for US unemployment claims and the Philly Fed manufacturing index. Canadian manufacturing sales are released at the same time. 

At 14.15, we get capacity utilisation rate and industrial production. 

## Trade Idea

The USD/JPY is in a short term down trend and the longer term trend is meandering lower. 

Taking a longer view, the USD/JPY still looks to have some downside.
