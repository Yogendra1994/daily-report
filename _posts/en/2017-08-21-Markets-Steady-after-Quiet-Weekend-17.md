## Morning Report: 07.00 London

Markets remains subdued this morning after a quiet weekend on the economic and geopolitical news front. The US dollar index is posting small gains, while the US dollar pairs consequently post minor losses generally. 

The yen pairs are following suit, with minor losses on the USD/JPY et al this morning. 

The NZD/USD has been bucking the trend, posting small gains so far. 

The EUR/GBP continues to out-perform, posting further gains this morning. 

Gold remains in demand though, making gains this morning despite Friday's reversal. 

## Coming up today

Coming up today, we have Canadian Wholesale Sales at 13.30 .

## Trade Idea

The pound remains soft this morning, as EU exit negotiations continue to drag. Meanwhile, the Australian dollar continues to enjoy its close links with China. 

The GBP/AUD has been a consistent loser in recent months and there seem to be no fundamental economic reasons why this might change in the near future.
