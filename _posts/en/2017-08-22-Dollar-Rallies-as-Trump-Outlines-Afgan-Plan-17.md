## Morning Report: 07.00 London

This morning, the US dollar is slightly stronger, pushing dollar pairs lower after Donald Trump outlined plans for Afghanistan. "Outlined" is the right descriptor as the plans were lacking in detail at this stage. 

The yen pairs are also on the rise as money flows out of the risk-averse yen into the US dollar.

Meanwhile, the euro is continuing its out-performance against the pound, with the EUR/GBP nudging higher. 

Gold is nipping back after extending its rally yesterday. 

## Coming up today

Today, we have UK public sector net borrowing at 09.30. 

German ZEW economic sentiment follows at 10.00. 

At 13.30, we get Canadian core retail sales. 

## Trade Idea

The pound continues to suffer, while the Canadian dollar is having a strong morning. The latter is benefiting from oil prices stabilising above $50.
