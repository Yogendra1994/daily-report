## Morning Report: 07.00 London

This morning, the dollar pairs are on the back foot as the dollar index makes gains and recovers from yesterday's Trump inspired losses.

The pound is continuing to struggle after heavy losses yesterday as sterling fell to its lowest levels since 2009. The EUR/GBP shot to new highs, while the GBP/JPY continued to tumble. 

Yen pairs are generally mixed, with most flat, but some such as the USD/JPY making gains. 

Meanwhile, the USD/CAD continues to trickle lower as oil prices stabilise. 

## Coming up today

Coming up today, we have UK second estimate GDP at 09.30, released alongside preliminary business investment. 

At 13.30, we get US unemployment claims. 

At 15.00, we get US existing home sales and mortgage delinquencies. 

## Trade Idea

The pound has fallen against a basket of currencies this week, but it is the GBP/USD that has more room to drop further.
