## Morning Report: 07.00 London

This morning, the US dollar is mixed after making small gains yesterday. US unemployment claims came in slightly below expectations, while US existing home sales dropped more than expected. 

The yen pairs are making gains as risk appetite increases. The USD/JPY is on the rise, while the GBP/JPY is following up yesterday's losses. 

Meanwhile, the pound is continuing to recover after in-line GDP figures. The EUR/GBP is trading lower for a second day in a row. 

## Coming up today

Coming up today, we have German Ifo business climate at 09.00. 

At 13.30, we get US durable goods orders. 

Fed chair Yellen speaks at 17.00. 

ECB president Draghi speaks at 20.00. 

## Trade Idea

The USD/CAD continues to drip lower, despite the stronger US dollar. Helping the drive lower is gold prices holding above the $50 level.
