## Morning Report: 07.00 London

The US is having to face up to the realities of climate change, with the dollar set for its biggest monthly losing streak for 14 years on the back of Hurricane Harvey. 

Dollar pairs are mixed this morning, with the EUR/USD heading lower, the GBP/USD unchanged and the AUD/USD making gains. 

Meanwhile, the yen pairs are on the rise, building on yesterday's strong rally. 

Gold is retreating from recent highs as the North Korea threat appears to recede. 

## Coming up today

Coming up today, we have UK net lending to individuals at 09.30. 

At 13.15, we get ADP non farm employment change. 

Canadian current account is released at 13.30, alongside US preliminary GDP. 

US crude oil inventories follow at 15.30. 

## Trade Idea

Gold is pulling back from the highs as risk appetite recedes. Global pressures still remain though and there could be further upside form here.
