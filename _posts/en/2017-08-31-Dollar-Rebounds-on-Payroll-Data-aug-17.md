## Morning Report: 07.00 London

This morning, the US dollar index is building on yesterday's gains, sparked by better than expected ADP Non-Farm Employment Change and preliminary GDP. 

The dollar pairs are consequently on the back foot, with the NZD/USD the worst performer, off 0.75%. The Aussie is not far behind this. 

The British pound is out-performing its peers, with the GBP/USD making only minor losses these last two days and the EUR/JPY rising. 

The yen pairs are on the rise as well, with the GBP/JPY leading the pack and the USD/JPY making it three straight days of gains. 

## Coming up today

Coming up today, we have European flash estimate at 10.00. 

We have Canadian GDP at 13.30, released alongside US unemployment claims and personal spending. 

At 14.45, we get Chicago PMI.

Pending home sales follow at 15.00. 

## Trade Idea

The dollar has turned this week for the positive, putting dollar pairs on the back foot. 

The NZD/USD has been the biggest faller for some time now and the trend is showing few signs of turning.
