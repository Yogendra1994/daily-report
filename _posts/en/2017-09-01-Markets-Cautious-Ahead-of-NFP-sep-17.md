## Morning Report: 07.00 London

Markets are cautious this morning ahead of today's all important Non Farm Payrolls. There are still some repercussions from yesterday's moves though as the yen pairs look to extend yesterday's losses. 

The USD/JPY, EUR/JPY and GBP/JPY are slipping lower, while the AUD/JPY is holding ground after making gains yesterday. 

The dollar pairs are on the back foot after gains yesterday. The AUD/USD is holding up well, while the NZD/USD continues to weaken, slipping lower again. 

The biggest move yesterday was on the USD/CAD as the Canadian dollar launched higher yesterday on the back of higher than expected GDP and oil prices. 

## Coming up today

Coming up today, we have manufacturing PMI at 09.30. 

At 13.30, we get US non farm employment change, average hourly earnings and the unemployment rate. 

At 15.00, we get ISM manufacturing PMI and revised UoM consumer sentiment. 

## Trade Idea

The recent storms hitting the US has exposed how vital the nation's energy production is to global markets, with prices rising on the back of distribution disruption. 

This hits the US dollar and helps the Canadian dollar.
