## Morning Report: 07.00 London

This morning, the US dollar is on the rise (slightly) as Hurricane Irma batters Florida. The extent of the impact is still emerging, but the dollar appears to be standing firm. 

Dollar pairs are mixed this morning, with gains for the NZD/USD. By contrast, most other pairs are lower especially the AUD/USD. 

The USD/CAD is higher on indications that Hurricane Irma’s impact on oil production won’t be as severe as expected. 

The yen pairs are pushing higher, with the USD/JPY leading and the GBP/JPY gapping higher. The AUD/JPY is recovering from gapping lower at the open. 

## Coming up today

We have a light day for economic news items, with Italian Industrial production the only item of moderate note. 

## Trade Idea

The AUD/USD keeps plugging away as tensions from North Korea subside for the moment.
