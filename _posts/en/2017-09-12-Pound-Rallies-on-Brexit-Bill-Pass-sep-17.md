## Morning Report: 07.00 London

The dollar is on the weaker side this morning after a strong showing yesterday as Hurricane Irma veered Westward to reduce its potential impact. 

Most dollar pairs are nudging higher, led by the GBP/USD which is emboldened by the passing of the Brexit bill last night in Parliament. 

Yen pairs are on the rise again, with the GBP/JPY a top performer as investors turn away from safe haven assets and embrace risk. The USD/JPY is unchanged, however. 

The EUR/GBP is slipping lower again as the pound continues to dominate the euro. 

Meanwhile, gold is slipping a little further from the highs as investors feel the worst is over with North Korea and Hurricane season. 

## Coming up today

Coming up today, we have UK CPI, PPI and RPI at 09.30. 

US JOLTS job openings are at 15.00. 

## Trade Idea

Has the Brexit worm turned? Itâ€™s unlikely given the complications ahead, but there do appear to be tailwinds behind the pound at the moment.
