## Morning Report: 07.00 London

This morning, the dollar remains strong as it continues its rebound for this week. Dollar pairs are mixed this morning after strong gains made yesterday. 

The EUR/USD and GBP/USD remain under pressure after heavy selling yesterday. 

The pound continues to outperform the euro this morning though ahead of todayâ€™s BOE meeting with the EUR/GBP continuing to tumble. 

The AUD/USD is out-performing this morning, on impressive employment change data while the NZD/USD is unchanged. 

Yen pairs have been mixed, with losses for the GBP/JPY and EUR/JPY, while the USD/JPY and AUD/JPY maintain a positive bias. 

## Coming up today

Today we have Swiss Libor and monetary policy assessment at 08.30. 

At 12.00, we get the MPC bank votes, bank rate and monetary policy summary. No significant change is expected, though shifts in the voting patterns could be of importance. 

At 13.30, we US CPI and unemployment claims. 

German Buba president Weidmann speaks at 16.30. 

## Trade Idea

The Australian dollar is performing well as tensions simmer in the Korean region. Added to this, the Australian economy is continuing to benefit from its close links with China.
