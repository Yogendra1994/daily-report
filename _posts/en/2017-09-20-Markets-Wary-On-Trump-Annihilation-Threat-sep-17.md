## Morning Report: 07.00 London

This morning, markets have a ‘risk-off’ bias following Trump’s remarkable speech last night in which he threatened to annihilate North Korea. The dollar index is trading lower again, giving dollar pairs a positive edge. Today’s FOMC meeting is also keeping traders in conservative mode. 

The EUR/USD is continuing its winning run as it makes gains for the fifth day in a row. Other dollar pairs are mixed, with the AUD/USD rising, but the GBP/USD flat. 

The yen is in demand as risk appetite wanes, the GBP/JPY is slipping lower, as is the USD/JPY while other yen pairs remain flat. 

Meanwhile, gold is making small gains so far. 

## Coming up today 

Coming up today, we have UK retail sales at 09.30. 

At 15.30, we get US crude oil inventories. 

The big show is the FOMC meeting at 19.00, with the Fed’s economic projections, statement, funds rate and press conference at 19.30. 

New Zealand GDP is at 23.45

## Trade Idea


This morning, the AUD/JPY is extending its rally despite tensions around North Korea and renewed interest in the Japanese yen. 

This speaks of underlying strength, with more upside on the cards from here.
