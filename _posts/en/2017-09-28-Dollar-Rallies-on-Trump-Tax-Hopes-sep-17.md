## Morning Report: 07.00 London

This morning, the US dollar is powering higher on hopes for Trump’s tax overhaul passing. The dollar index is on the rise, with dollar pairs dropping further. 

The AUD/USD has extended its losing run, with the GBP/USD now set for five losing days in a row and the NZD/USD four. 

The yen pairs are performing better, with the USD/JPY rallying. 

Gold continues to soften though as the dollar takes hold. 

## Coming up today 

Coming up today, we have BOE governor Carney speaking at 09.15. 

RBA assistant governor Debelle speaks at 10.00. 

At 13.30, we have US final GDP and unemployment claims. 

FOMC member Fischer speaks at 15.15. 

Prime Minister May is scheduled to speak at some point throughout the day. 

## Trade Idea

 The Australian dollar’s decline shows little sign of abating, making a LOWER trade attractive.
