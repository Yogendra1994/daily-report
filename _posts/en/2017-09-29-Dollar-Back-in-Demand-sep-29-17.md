## Morning Report: 07.00 London

This morning, the US dollar is back in demand after nipping back yesterday. This pull-back came despite better than expected US GDP data. 

The AUD/USD continues to suffer, selling off for its fifth straight day. Meanwhile, the NZD/USD has been performing better, with mixed trading this week. 

The GBP/USD broke its losing run yesterday with gains, but is back on the losing run again today. 

The yen pairs are on the rise though, helped by the recovering US dollar. 

## Coming up today

Today, we have UK current account data at 09.30, released alongside final GDP and net lending to individuals 

At 10.00, we have European CPI flash estimate. 

Canadian GDP is at 13.30. 

Also at 13.30, we get US Core PCE price index and personal spending. 

At 14.45, we have US Chicago PMI. 

BOE governor Carney speaks at 15.00. 

Also at 15.00, we get US revised UoM consumer sentiment. 

FOMC member Harker speaks at 16.00.

## Trade Idea

Gold has lost its glitter of late, but there could be more downside in the pipeline.
