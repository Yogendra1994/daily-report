## Morning Report: 07.00 London

This morning, the US dollar is on the rise, following up on yesterday’s gains from renewed Fed rate hike talk and better than expected unemployment claims. Analysts are expecting a relatively small increase in payrolls of 82k today. 

Dollar pairs are on the back foot, especially the AUD/USD which is being hit by talk of a rate hike from the RBA. The NZD/USD’s downtrend has followed suit. 

The USD/CAD is rising again after poor trade balance data yesterday. 

The EUR/USD is down, but it’s the GBP/USD that is struggling again, with the pound extending its losing run against the dollar. The EUR/GBP is rising as the euro continues its outperformance. 

Yen pairs are following a similar pattern, with the GBP/JPY and AUD/JPY slumping. 

## Coming up today 

Today we have the UK Halifax HPI housing report. 

At 13.30, we get the big US jobs report including non-farm employment change, the unemployment rate and average hourly earnings. 

Canadian employment change and unemployment data is also released at 13.30. 

We get Ivey PMI at 15.00. 

## Trade Idea

With the prospect of a leadership challenge to Theresa May, markets are taking a dim view of the pound at the moment.
