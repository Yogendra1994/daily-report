## Morning Report: 07.00 London

For the first time in a number of sessions, the US dollar has significantly backed off this morning. The US dollar index is on the back foot, helping the main dollar pairs to rise. 

The AUD/USD is leading the charge, up 0.41%, with the NZD/USD higher but lagging. 

The euro doesnâ€™t appear to be too encumbered by the Catalonia independence unrest, with the EUR/USD making solid gains and the EUR/GBP also rising. 

The pound is higher with the GBP/USD up for the third day in a row, this comes as Theresa May survives her latest challenge. Some are now commenting that May could we be the best option on acceptance that Tory/EU divisions run deep. 

Yen pairs are mixed as the USD/JPY remains in a tight trading range. 

## Coming up today 

Today, we have UK manufacturing production at 09.30, released alongside goods trade balance. 

At 13.30, we get Canadian building permits. 

FOMC member Kashkari speaks at 15.00. 

## Trade Idea

The NZD/USD remains weak, experiencing the smallest rebound of the dollar pairs. If the US dollar is to rebound this week, it could be the NZD/USD where we see the biggest falls.
