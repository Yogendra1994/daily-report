## Morning Report: 07.00 London

This morning, the euro is trading lower after Austria opted to elect the world’s youngest leader at 31, with the far right freedom party scoring its best results in two year. The EUR/GBP is trading lower again, while EUR/USD slips for the third day in a row. 

Dollar pairs are on the back foot generally with the exception of the NZD/USD which gapped higher this morning. The pound is holding its own though ahead of tomorrow’s inflation data. 

The dollar index is nudging higher as the dollar recovery continues. 

The USD/JPY is unchanged so far, with the USD/JPY gapping higher this morning. 

Gold is pausing a potentially on the back foot for the first time in seven session.
