This morning, the pound is steady ahead of today’s inflation data where CPI and RPI are expected to rise. The EUR/GBP is slipping lower again. 

The US dollar is on the rise, pushing dollar pairs generally lower. The EUR/USD is down, as is the NZD/USD. The GBP/USD is unchanged, while the AUD/USD is actually making gains. 

The yen pairs are following suit, with the EUR/JPY making losses while most other pairs are unchanged. 

Gold is extending yesterday’s reversal as precious metals stumble despite oil prices spiking yesterday.
