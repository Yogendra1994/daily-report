## Morning Report: 07.00 London

This morning, the US dollar remains dominant as money floods out of the euro and into the Greenback. The main catalyst was a solid set of US corporate earnings last night, with Alphabet, Amazon and Twitter trading sharply higher. 

The big move yesterday came from the ECB which opted to half its asset purchases but extend their activities until at least September of next year. The euro was volatile in the immediate aftermath, but ended the day firmly lower. All July and the EUR/GBP ending sharply lower. 

The AUD/USD is continuing its sell-off, with the AUD/JPY following suit. 

The pound also came in for heavy selling yesterday, with the GBP/USD reversing Thursdayâ€™s rally and a flat performance this morning. 

Elsewhere, the USD/CAD has continued its advance, marking seven straight days of gains for the pair. 

Gold is unchanged this morning, but yesterday continued its reversal. 

## Coming up today 

Today, we have US advance GDP at 13.30, released alongside advance GDP price index. 

At 15.00, we have revised UoM consumer sentiment. 

## Trade Idea

The USD/CAD has risen steadily in recent days as the dollar remains dominant.
