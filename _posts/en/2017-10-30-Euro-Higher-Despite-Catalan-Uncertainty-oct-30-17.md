## Morning Report: 07.00 London

This morning, the euro is trading slightly higher despite uncertainty surrounding the next steps for Catalonia and Spain as Madrid takes direct control of the region. The EUR/USD has gapped higher at the open, while the EUR/GBP is higher. 

The dollar is off the pace despite GDP data coming in above expectations on Friday. 

The Australian dollar is nudging higher, while the NZD/USD is the worst performing currency so far today, testing new lows for the month. 

The USD/CAD is unchanged after Friday’s reversal. This comes despite oil prices sustaining near the highs. 

The USD/JPY is unchanged after Friday’s reversal. 


## Coming up today 

Today, we have UK net lending to individuals at 09.30. 

Following this we get US Core CPE and personal spending at 12.30. 

## Trade Idea

The EUR/USD is under pressure, but there is clear room for further downside from here.
