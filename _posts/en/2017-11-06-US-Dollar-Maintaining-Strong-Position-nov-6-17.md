## Morning Report: 07.00 London

This morning, the US dollar is maintaining its strong position despite Fridayâ€™s mixed set of employment figures. US Average earnings and non farm employment changed dropped more than expected. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate dropped to 4.1%, with ISM non-manufacturing PMI rising more than expected. Overall, these were disappointing numbers, yet the dollar managed to peek out gains on Friday and so far this morning. 

The USD/JPY is on the rise, ironically as Trump meets with Shinzo Abe to discuss trade deals. The USD/JPY continues to rise and is challenging the highs from May and July. 

The yen pairs generally have a positive bias, but the medium and long term looks mixed. 

The dollar pairs have a negative bias this morning, with the AUD/USD looking vulnerable after heavy selling Friday. The GBP/USD is lower after an attempted recovery Friday. 

Gold continues to slip lower as the dollar continues to slip from the September highs. 

## Coming up today 

Today, we have a slew of minor economic releases from Europe from 08.15, including German final services PMI. 

At 15.00, we get Canadian Ivey PMI. 

FOMC member Dudley speaks at 17.10. 

## Trade Idea

After days of a counter rally, the NZD/USD appears to be trading lower again this morning. Inflation expectations dropped for New Zealand this morning, which could point to lower levels for the NZD/USD.
