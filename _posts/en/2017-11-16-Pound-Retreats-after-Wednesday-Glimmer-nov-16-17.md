## Morning Report: 07.00 London

This morning, the British pound is slipping back after impressing yesterday with better than expected average earnings and claimant count change. The EUR/GBP is nudging higher again, with the GBP/USD dropping while the EUR/USD rallies. 

The euro is outperforming, with the EUR/JPY rallying with intent. 

The yen pairs are on the rise as the Japanese yen eases off. Aside, from the EUR/JPY, the AUD/JPY and USD/JPY are making notable gains while the GBP/JPY lags. 

The dollar pairs are on the back foot with the exception of the EUR/USD which is making small gains. The NZD/USD is lower, while the GBP/USD continues to lag. 

Meanwhile, the USD/CAD is making gains while oil prices continue to retreat.

At 10.00, we get European final CPI. 

At 13.30, we switch to North America for US unemployment claims, import prices and Philly Fed Manufacturing. At the same time we get Canadian foreign securities and manufacturing sales.

## Trade Idea

The NZD/USD has tracked the AUD/USD lower of late, with further downsides on the cards.
