## Morning Report: 07.00 London

This morning, the euro has been hit hard by the breakdown of talks to form a ruling German coalition, triggering fresh elections. The EUR/USD and EUR/GBP have gapped lower, with the former down 0.43%. Meanwhile, the EUR/JPY is at its lowest levels since September. 

By contrast, the GBP/USD is performing well, making gains as the dollar softens. 

The Australian dollar is nudging higher after the AUD/JPY made significant losses on Friday. The NZD/USD is also higher after heavy selling last week. 

The USD/JPY is so far unchanged after Fridayâ€™s losses. The US dollar index is slipping lower after opening slightly higher. 

## Coming up today 

At 14.00, we get ECB president Draghi speaking and again at 16.00. 

MPC member Ramsden speaks at 18.30. 

## Trade Idea

The NZD/USD is slightly higher this morning, but the general trend remains negative.
