## Morning Report: 07.00 London

The Australian dollar is weaker again this morning after the RBA sounded a note of caution in the release of its latest minutes. The AUD/USD is trickling lower as the AUD/JPY undoes some of yesterday’s losses. 

Elsewhere, the euro remains weak after under-performing the pound yesterday. The single currency is under pressure amid talk of Angela Merkel leaving power for the first time in over 12 years. The EUR/GBP is lower, while the EUR/JPY is unchanged after making significant gains yesterday. 

The yen pairs have a negative bias after yesterday’s rally which saw the USD/JPY post one of its best days of the month to date. 

The dollar index is unchanged after making gains yesterday. 

## Coming up today 

Today we have RBA governor Lowe speaking at 09.05.

The inflation report hearings are at 10.00. 

Canadian wholesale sales are released at 13.30.

## Trade Idea

The USD/CAD has continued to climb despite oil prices remaining above $60.00. Oil has come off the boil recently, but this still points to an underlying strength in the US dollar are apparent weakness in the Canadian dollar.
