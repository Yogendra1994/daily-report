## Morning Report: 07.00 London

This morning, the Australian dollar is on the back foot after Aussie GDP came in below estimates this morning. The AUD/JPY is now down 0.75%, with the AUD/USD down 0.33%. 

The dollar pairs generally have a positive bias as the dollar index slips back. The NZD/USD is outperforming, breaking away from the pressures on the AUD/USD. 

The pound is trading higher in line with other pairs this morning, but has some way to go to recover from yesterdayâ€™s losses on the back of poor services PMI data. 

The yen pairs are negative this morning, with the GBP/JPY now down for three days in a row on Brexit negotiation failures. 

## Coming up today 

Coming up today, we have US ADP non-farm employment change at 13.15. 

Canadian labour productivity is at 13.30. 

At 15.00, we get the BOC rate statement and overnight rate. 

US crude oil inventories are released at 15.30. 

## Trade Idea

The AUD/JPY is slipping lower this morning as the Aussie economy shows signs of weakness.
