## Morning Report: 07.00 London

This morning, the dollar index is further eating into Fridayâ€™s gains, extending the indifferent run seen since the start of the month.

The dollar pairs are higher this morning, but most are stuck within chopping trading ranges. The NZD/USD and AUD/USD are showing the strongest short terms trends, rising clearly off the December lows. 

GBP/USD and EUR/USD have been in general decline since the start of the month, with the former especially showing positivity this morning. 

Yen pairs have a slight negative bias so far this morning. This is helping the AUD/JPY to extend its tentative rally off the December lows. 

The USD/CAD remains within touching distance of the December highs though. 

## Coming up today 

This morning, we have US building permits, current account and housing starts at 13.30. 

At 21.45, we get New Zealand current account and trade balance. 

## Trade Idea

The GBP/USD has been stuck in an indifferent range of late, but the overall trend bias remains positive.
