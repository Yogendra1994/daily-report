## Coming up today

BOE governor Carney speaks at 13.15. 

At 15.00, we get US existing home sales. 

US crude oil inventories are at 15.30. 

## Trade Idea

The New Zealand dollar is pulled back this, in line with the medium term trend. The AUD/USD has led the Kiwi lower since October, but yet to reverse. 

In this situation, it could pay to follow the longer term trend and bet on further downside for the AUD/USD.
