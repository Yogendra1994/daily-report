## Morning Report: 07.00 London

This morning, the Japanese yen has a negative bias after the BOJ opted to pass this morningâ€™s meeting without any significant changes. The USD/JPY and other yen pairs are on the rise. 

The AUD/JPY is continuing to rally in particular, while the AUD/USD slips back. 

The dollar pairs have a slight negative bias as the dollar index increases. The EUR/USD is pausing after three days of solid gains. 

## Coming up today 

Coming up today, we have UK public sector net borrowing at 09.30. 

Canadian CPI and retail sales data are at 13.30. 

Also at 13.30 we get US final GDP, Philly Fed manufacturing and unemployment claims. 

## Trade Idea

While the AUD/USD is showing signs of strains, the AUD/JPY continues to accumulate, helped by the yen lifting off the pace.
