## Morning Report: 07.00 London

This morning, the US dollar has a positive bias, but the damage was done yesterday as tax cut optimism reversed. 

This was good news for dollar pairs has they climbed across the board. The NZD/USD led the pack with solid gains, while the AUD/USD continued its winning run. The latter is performing poorly this morning though.

The EUR/USD performed well, reversing all of Wednesday’s losses and is performing well this morning. The GBP/USD is outperforming this morning after lagging these last two days. The EUR/GBP is dipping lower as a result. 

The USD/CAD has continued to slip lower as the Canadian dollar is fed by higher oil prices and the US dollar weakens. 

The yen pairs are lifting higher, led by the EUR/JPY which is continuing its excellent run.  

Gold is slipping back this morning after a solid recovery yesterday.

Stepping back and looking at the longer term, the EUR/JPY has maintained a winning run since September 2016. 

It could pay to bet on further upside from here.
