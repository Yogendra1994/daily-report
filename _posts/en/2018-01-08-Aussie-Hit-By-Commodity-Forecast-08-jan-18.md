## Morning Report: 07.00 London

This morning, the Australian dollar is under pressure after a government reporting predicting a 20% fall in iron ore prices. The AUD/USD is off this morning, as is the AUD/JPY which is reversing Friday’s gains. The NZD/USD as a more positive bias however. 

The US dollar index is on the rise as it recovers from Friday’s reversal. US Non Farm Payrolls came in below estimates, while non-manufacturing PMI also disappointed. 

The EUR/GBP has gapped lower as the mood turns against the euro. Both the EUR/USD and GBP/USD are reversing this morning, but the former is recovering from a Friday losing session. 

The yen pairs are mixed, with the USD/JPY continuing its consistent winning run, while most other yen pairs are making reversals this morning – notably the AUD/JPY. 

The USD/CAD is reversing higher after heavy selling on Friday. 

## Coming up today 

Today, we have Halifax HPI at 08.30. 

At 15.30, we get Canadian BOC business outlook survey. 

FOMC member Bostic speaks at 17.40, with Williams speaking 18.35. 

## Trade Idea

The USD/CAD is reversed heavily on Friday as oil price pressure continues to drive the pair lower. 

With crude prices hovering around the $67.00 level, there could be further downside from here.
