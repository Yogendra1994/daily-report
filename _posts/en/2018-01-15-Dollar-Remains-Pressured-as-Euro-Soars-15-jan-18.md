## Morning Report: 07.00 London

This morning, the US dollar index remains under pressure following Friday’s session which saw counter pressure from the euro and pound. The euro surged on hope of a breakthrough in German coalition talks. In addition, US retail sales dropped more than expected. The EUR/USD is now up 1.81% on the month, lagging the GBP/USD slightly which is up 1.85%. 

The EUR/GBP remains rangebound, with a slight gain for the pair in the favour of the euro this morning. 

The AUD/USD remains strong, with four solid days in a row including today’s out-performance. The AUD/USD remains the top performer on the month. The NZD/USD is higher and recovering from yesterday’s losses. 

The USD/JPY remains on the back foot, breaching the November lows this morning. The other yen pairs remain subdued. 

The USD/CAD is gapping lower this morning as dollar pressure intensifies and oil prices close in on $70.00. 

## Coming up today 

US banks are closed today in honour of Martin Luther King day. 

MPC member Tenreyro speaks at 18.15. 

## Trade Idea

With the dollar index under pressure, you could take your pick on dollar pairs. 

The Aussie is showing the most impressive momentum though, making the AUD/USD the more attractive bet.
