## Morning Report: 07.00 London

This morning, the dollar is slightly stronger, but there has been a muted reaction to the US government shutdown. The dollar index is slightly higher. 

The dollar pairs are on the back foot with the EUR/USD sliding more than most ahead of Thursday’s ECB meeting. The euro’s underperformance is causing the EUR/GBP to slip lower again. 

The yen pairs are on the mixed as money flows from the yen and into the dollar. The USD/JPY is on the rise, but other pairs are struggling with the EUR/JPY slipping lower again after gapping higher. 

## Coming up today 

Today we have Canadian wholesale sales at 13.30. 

## Trade Idea

Despite the euro plunging last week, the EUR/GBP remains within largely within the trading range seen since the start of October.
