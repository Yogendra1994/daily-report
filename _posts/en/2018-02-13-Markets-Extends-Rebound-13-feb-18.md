## Morning Report: 07.00 London

This morning, world markets look set to extend their recovery, with the US dollar index backing off. The dollar pairs are generally higher, led by the EUR/USD which is setting up for two straight days of gains. 

The AUD/USD continues to push higher after Monday’s opening gap higher, while the NZD/USD mirrors a similar run. 

The GBP/USD is higher but the pound is generally lagging other pairs, helping the EUR/GBP to rise for the third straight day. 

Across yen pairs, the USD/JPY is leading a negative bias and heading for the September lows. The AUD/JPY is reversing yesterday’s gains, while the EUR/JPY holds up relatively well. 

## Coming up today 

Coming up today, we have UK CPI at 09.30 and RP at the same time. 

At 13.00, we have US FOMC member Mester speaking at 13.00. 

## Trade Idea

The USD/JPY continues to back off as the dollar rate hike excitement subsides. There could be more where this came from, making a LOWER trade attractive.
