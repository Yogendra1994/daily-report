## Morning Report: 07.00 London

This morning, the Japanese yen continues to flirt with 17 months highs as it continues as the currency of choice amid the trade war turbulence. The USD/JPY is unchanged after consistent losses last week. Other yen pairs have lifted slightly higher, with the AUD/JPY lead up, up 0.50%. 

The AUD/USD has gapped higher, as traders re-assess the Aussies following last week’s dire employment data. The NZD/USD is continuing to out-perform. 

The dollar pairs are generally higher, as the dollar index extends Friday’s losses. The GBP/USD has shown some early thrust on Brexit hopes, gapping higher. The EUR/USD is also higher, while the EUR/GBP gapped lower and has climbed through the morning session. 

The Canadian dollar continues to claw back losses, as the USD/CAD slips lower. This comes as oil prices rebound rapidly to come within range of the 2018 highs. 

## Coming up today 

Coming up today, we have German Buba President Weidmann speaking at 10.30. 

FOMC member Dudley speaks at 17.30. 

FOMC member Mester speaks at 21.30. 

## Trade Idea

While the AUD/JPY is impressing this morning, the yen’s strength is hard to ignore. 

With global trade war threats continuing to threaten, there could be further downside from here.
