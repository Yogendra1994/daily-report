## Morning Report: 07.00 London

This morning, global risk appetite has dampened after US tech stocks sold off further last night. The yen is in demand, pushing the USD/JPY lower after yesterday’s solid gains. 

Other yen pairs are following suit, with the EUR/JPY and GBP/JPY slipping lower. The AUD/JPY appears to be bouncing around the lows. 

Dollar pairs are mostly in the black this morning, with gains for the likes of the EUR/USD and GBP/USD. The AUD/USD too push pushing higher. The US dollar index made sizeable gains yesterday as GDP came in above estimates. The NZD/USD is the main exception, with losses to follow on from yesterday.
