## Morning Report: 07.00 London

This morning, the US dollar has continued to recover, adding to yesterday’s gains. The gains come following strong US data yesterday, with manufacturing sales, housing starts and industrial production coming in above expectations. 

The dollar pairs have been on the back foot, though are making small gains this morning. The pound in particular reversed, with the GBP/USD slipping from its 2018 highs. The EUR/GBP recovered Monday’s losses as the EUR/USD held its ground relatively. 

The yen pairs are on the rise this morning as the yen gives way to the dollar in the global exchanges. The USD/JPY remains range bound, but the GBP/JPY has recovered yesterday’s losses, while the EUR/JPY builds some fresh momentum. 

The USD/CHF surged yesterday, keeping the pair’s strong momentum up. 

Gold has continued to pull back – as precious metals give way to the strong dollar.  

## Coming up today 

Today, we have a stern test for the pound’s recent rally, starting with UK CPI, PPI and RPI at 09.30. 

European final CPI is at 10.00.
