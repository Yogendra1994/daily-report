## Morning Report: 07.00 London

This morning, the US dollar index is pausing after extending it’s impressive bull run yesterday. US treasury yields approached 3% as earnings from tech giants continued to impress. 

The dollar pairs are recovering, with small gains this morning following another day of losses. The GBP/USD made it five straight days of losses yesterday, while the NZD/USD is continuing to sell-off, falling for six straight days. 

The EUR/USD is finding support at the 1.2200 level, underling its general relative strength over the last seven days. The EUR/GBP is unchanged this morning. European PMI data largely came out better than expected yesterday. 

The AUD/USD is trading higher after three days of straight losses. CPI data largely came out as expected this morning. 

The USD/JPY surged yesterday, with 109.00 the next challenge. Yen pairs are generally mixed, with gains for the EUR/JPY. 

## Coming up today 

This morning, we have German Ifo business climate at 09.00. 

At 09.30, we have UK public sector net borrowing. 

US consumer confidence follows at 15.00. 

## Trade Idea

This morning, the USD/JPY is on the rise, helped by the ever weakening yen and the resurgent US dollar. 

The trend looks well worth following, with a HIGHER trade a good way to play this.
