## Morning Report: 07.00 London

This morning, the US Dollar index continues to rise, fuelled by worries over US earnings and soaring treasury yields.

Dollar pairs are on the back foot once again, with the AUD/USD leading the fallers. The Aussie is now down 1.2% on the week, breaking the 0.7600 level. 

The EUR/USD and GBP/USD both rallied yesterday. The euro is falling harder though, with this morning’s selling erasing most of yesterday’s gains though. The EUR/GBP is unchanged this morning after follow on selling yesterday. 

The yen pairs continue to climb, with the USD/JPY breaching the 109 level from below. Other yen pairs are mixed, with the AUD/JPY falling, while the GBP/JPY and EUR/JPY gaining. 

Gold is on the back foot and continues to be rangebound, with $1320 acting as support. 

## Coming up today

The only item of note today is US crude oil inventories at 15.30. 

BOC Poloz speaks at 21.15. 

## Trade Idea

The Swiss franc has continue to slip, while the US dollar strengthens. The USD/CHF is now approaching parity, a level not seen since November last year. 

Parity could be on the cards again, but it could be short lived like last time, making a ONE TOUCH trade attractive.
