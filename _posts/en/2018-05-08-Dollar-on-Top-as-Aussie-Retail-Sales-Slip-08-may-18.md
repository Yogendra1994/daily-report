## Morning Report: 07.00 London

This morning, the US dollar is firmly in the driving seat, with dollar pairs such as the AUD/USD falling further overnight. Aussie retail sales dropped more than expected, while Chinese trade balance disappointed. The AUD/USD is off by 0.25%, while the AUD/JPY continues its steady down trend. 

The Swiss Franc continues to crumble against the dollar, with the USD/CHF trading firmly above parity. 

The EUR/USD is continuing its down trend, testing the 1.1900 levels, while the EUR/JPY breaks 130.00 to the downside after falling for nine straight sessions. 

The EUR/GBP dropped heavily yesterday as the pound firmed despite ongoing Brexit worries. The GBP/USD is dropping through after rising yesterday. 

The USD/CAD has a positive bias as oil prices are pressured as Trump reaches an Iran deal.  

## Coming up today

UK Halifax HPI is at 08.30. 

The Aussie Annual budget release is at 10.30.

## Trade Idea

The EUR/USD continues to weaken in the face of the ever-strong US dollar. Further downside is on the cards as momentum remains against the euro.
