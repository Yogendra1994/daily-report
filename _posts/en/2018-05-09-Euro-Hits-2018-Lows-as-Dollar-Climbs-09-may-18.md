## Morning Report: 07.00 London

The dollar index is in control once again as dollar pairs fall on the back foot. This comes despite Trump removing the US from the Iran nuclear deal. 

The EUR/USD is trading well below 1.1900, extending its recent losing run. The GBP/USD is also struggling, but is holding up relatively well compared to the euro. The EUR/GBP fell yesterday though is unchanged this morning. 

Meanwhile, the AUD/USD continues its losing run, falling to its lowest level since June 2017. 

Yen pairs have a positive bias though, helped by the resurgent dollar. This reverses what has been a consistent losing run for many pairs. 

## Coming up today

Today, we have US PPI and Canadian building permits at 13.30. 

US crude oil inventories are at 15.30. 

The New Zealand rate statement is at 22.00. 

## Trade Idea

The AUD/USD has been on a consistent losing run, as the Australasian region comes under consistent pressure.
