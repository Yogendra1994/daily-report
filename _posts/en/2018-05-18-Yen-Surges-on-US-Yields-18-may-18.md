## Morning Report: 07.00 London

There are numerous threads pulling at markets at the moment, including stress on emerging markets and Argentina, oil prices at 3 ½ year highs and soaring US Treasury yields. The clearest reaction has been seen on the USD/JPY as the yen soars on safe-haven interest. The USD/JPY is approaching 111.00 after breaking just three days ago. 

Other yen pairs are on the rise, with the GBP/JPY knocking on the doors of 150.00. 

The US dollar index remains at the highs, though has a negative bias this morning. 

Dollar pairs are generally on the front foot this morning, with small gains for the EUR/USD and AUD/USD. The GBP/USD is struggling, however. 

Gold continues to struggle after Tuesday’s collapse, while silver is holding up relatively well. 

## Coming up today

FOMC Mester speaks at 08.00. 

Canadian inflation is at 13.30

## Trade Idea

The dollar may be under some pressure this morning, but the pound has many question markets hanging over it, not least its menopausal economy.
