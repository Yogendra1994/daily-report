Meanwhile, the Aussie dollar has gapped higher against the US dollar on hopes that the US-Chinese trade war wonâ€™t disrupt the Aussie economy. The AUD/JPY continues to trade higher after gapping at the opening. 

The yen pairs generally continue to climb, breaking 111.00 as the dollar dominates and the yen takes a back seat. The EUR/JPY is higher amid choppy trading, while the GBP/JPY gapped higher at the open, but still lags its peers.
