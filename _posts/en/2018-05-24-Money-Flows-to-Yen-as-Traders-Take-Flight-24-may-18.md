## Morning Report: 07.00 London

The Japanese yen is in demand as traders take fright of Trump’s treatment of the China negotiations. Dovish Fed minutes also depressed the dollar, helping money to flow into the yen. The USD/JPY is the worst performer so far, extending recent losses and down 0.55%. 

Other yen pairs have continued to slide with the EUR/JPY and GBP/JPY off by 1.72% and 1.92% on the week respectively. The AUD/JPY is holding up slightly better by contrast as the Aussie holds up well. 

The pound and euro slumped yesterday as economic data failed to impress. European manufacturing and services PMI largely slumped prompting the EUR/USD to slump to 1.1700. Meanwhile, the GBP/USD slumped with the EUR/GBP dropping after UK inflation increased less than expected.

The Swiss franc is in control, with the USD/CHF dropping this morning and the EUR/CHF tanking. 

The AUD/USD is holding up relatively well though despite regional tensions relating to China.

## Trade Idea

The EUR/USD continues to struggle in the face of worsening economic data and Italian politics. There could be further downside from here as the dollar keeps up demand.
