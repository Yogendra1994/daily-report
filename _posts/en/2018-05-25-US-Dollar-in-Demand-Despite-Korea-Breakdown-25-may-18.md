## Morning Report: 07.00 London

The US dollar is back in demand amid a general retreat into risk-off trading. This comes as Trump cancels the planned North Korea summit and generally poor US economic data. 

The yen was in control yesterday, as traders switched out of the dollar on poor US unemployment and existing home sales. The USD/JPY dropped heavily as traders took safety in the yen, though this trend is reversing this morning. Other yen pairs such as the GBP/JPY and EUR/JPY are flat to negative after significant reversals yesterday. 

The dollar index is back on the rise this morning, forcing the dollar pairs on the back foot. The likes of the AUD/USD, GBP/USD and EUR/USD are making moderate losses after moderate gains made yesterday. 

The Swiss franc is following a similar trend, with the USD/CHF gaining following losses yesterday. 

The USD/CAD has continued to climb as the oil price bull run loses momentum. 

Gold is slipping back after significant gains made yesterday with traders hunting for safe harbours.

## Trade Idea
