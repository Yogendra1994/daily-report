## Morning Report: 07.00 London

This morning, markets are reeling from Trump’s mooted threat to levy more than $200bn of Chinese goods. Markets have been shaken by this move, sending the Japanese yen soaring as traders seek out safe harbours. The USD/JPY is selling off for the second straight day. The AUD/JPY continues to falter, heading to the 81.00 level which has acted as support for some time. This makes six days of losses for the AUD/JPY. The GBP/JPY and EUR/JPY are also feeling the strain and selling off. 

Dollar pairs are mixed, with the EUR/USD and GBP/USD unchanged. The EUR/GBP is slightly lower after two days of gains. The AUD/USD is continuing to sell off though.

The USD/CAD is at multi month highs above 1.3200, despite oil prices recovering yesterday. The USD/CHF is selling off for the second straight day however. 

Gold continues to make small gains after Friday’s mega losses. 

## Coming up today

ECB president Draghi speaks at 09.00. 

US building permits are at 13.30, with housing starts at the same time. 

## Trade Idea

The AUD/JPY has been steadily dripping lower as US tariffs potentially hurt the Chinese economy and the Australian economy by proxy.
