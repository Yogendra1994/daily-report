The Canadian dollar continues to suffer, with the USD/CAD continuing to make fresh 2018 highs despite oil prices remaining within a stretch of the highs.

The yen pairs continue to add to yesterday’s gains, with the USD/JPY showing the greatest gains and trading above 110.50. The other yen pairs are on the rise with the GBP/JPY and EUR/JPY marking two days of gains.
