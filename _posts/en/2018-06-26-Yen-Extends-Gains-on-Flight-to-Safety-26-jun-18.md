## Morning Report: 07.00 London

The Japanese yen remains in favour amid a general flight to safety. Markets remains spooked by the prospect of a global trader war and confusing US messages over the treatment of foreign investments. The USD/JPY continues to drop from the highs as the yen takes control. 

The AUD/JPY continues to suffer as the Australian dollar is caught out in fall out surrounding China’s prospects. The AUD/JPY is trading just above the 81.00 level. The GBP/JPY and EUR/JPY are holding up relatively well by contrast. 

The US dollar is also losing ground to the safe haven of the Swiss franc, with the USD/CHF continuing to slip lower. 

Generally, dollar pairs have a positive bias by contrast, with the GBP/USD and EUR/USD climbing higher. The AUD/USD is unchanged and struggling though. 

Gold continues to sell-off, slipping towards the $1260 level. 

## Coming up today

Coming up today, we have MPC member Haskel speaking at 10,00, alongside MPC member 

US Consumer confidence is at 15.00. 

FOMC member Bostic speaks at 18.00. 

## Trade Idea

The Swiss franc is picking up the pace again as traders seek out safe harbours. With the dollar struggling, there’s further downside potential for the USD/CHF.
