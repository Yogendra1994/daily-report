## Morning Report: 07.00 London

This morning, markets generally remain defensive, with the US dollar remaining in control as the global trade spat continues. The US dollar index has regained some of its poise after selling off since the 21st. 

The AUD/USD has continued to dribble lower back towards the June lows as the NZD/USD slumps to its lowest levels for the year. 

The GBP/USD and EUR/USD remain unchanged after suffering reversals yesterday. 

The US dollar remains in firm control against the Canadian dollar, with the USD/CAD pushing back towards the highs following oil producers increasing output. 

Th yen pairs are on the back foot, led by the AUD/JPY which is sitting just above the 81.00 support level. Other yen pairs are on the back foot. 

Gold and silver are the markets being the hardest right now, with gold slumping to its lowest levels for the year on the strong dollar and dominance of the yen as a global safe haven.
