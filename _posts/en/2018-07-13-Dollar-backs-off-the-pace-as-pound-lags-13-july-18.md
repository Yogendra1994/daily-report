## Morning Report: 07.00 London

The US dollar has lifted off the pace somewhat, though dollar pairs are mixed in their reaction. The AUD/USD is capitalising on this and building on yesterday’s gains. The GBP/USD and EUR/USD are subdued however, with the pound marking three days of gains against the dollar. 

The USD/CHF is unchanged after rising sharply towards the highs yesterday. Meanwhile, the USD/CAD lost ground yesterday and is unchanged this morning as oil prices firm. 

The USD/JPY is unchanged after reaching a high of 112.75 overnight. 

Gold remains just above support around $1240, while silver also looks poised for another test of the lows after two attacks of $15.80 already in July. 


## Coming up today

Today, we have MPC member Cunliffe speaking at 12.00. 

Preliminary US Consumer Sentiment is at 15.00. 

## Trade Idea

Gold may have found support at $1240 recently, with this level stretching back to December. However, the dollar index remains strong, meaning the $1240 level could well be broken in the near term.
