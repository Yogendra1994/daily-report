## Morning Report: 07.00 London

The Japanese yen remains the power broker across currency markets, as the USD/JPY attempts to reverse yesterday’s gains. 

The AUD/JPY is seeing the biggest losses, with the pair reversing heavily from the 83.50 level 82.00 in just three days. The EUR/JPY has reversed yesterday’s recovery and is challenging the 130.00 level. Meanwhile, the GBP/JPY is below the 146.00 level and sinking. 

The AUD/USD is continuing Monday’s opening reversal. The EUR/USD is following a similar trend, with the GBP/USD mirroring these moves. 

The EUR/CHF continues to weaken, as does the EUR/GBP which is slipping further from the 0.8950 level. 

Gold sentiment continues to sour, driving the precious metal to its lowest closing levels of the year.

## Coming up today

This morning we have a range of European flash manufacturing and services PMI data, starting with French data at 08.00. German data is at 08.30, with European data at 09.00. 

## Trade Idea

The euro continues to weaken against Swiss franc, with the May lows a likely target.
