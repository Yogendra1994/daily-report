## Morning Report: 07.00 London

Markets are generally quiet ahead of a busy week for world currencies. We have major announcements from the BoJ, Fed and BOE alongside major economic releases from the US with Non Farm Payrolls. The pound is out-performing, with the GBP/USD unchanged while the EUR/USD falls. The GBP/JPY is making small counter trend gains. The EUR/GBP has gapped below 0.8900 at the open. This comes ahead of today’s net lending to individuals from the UK. 

The AUD/USD is on the back foot as the pair remains stuck within a rangebound pattern. The USD/CHF is on the rise as the US dollar dominates again. The dollar is losing ground against the Canadian dollar however. 

The yen pairs generally have a positive bias this morning, led by a counter trend rally from the GBP/JPY and the EUR/JPY. The EUR/JPY remains within its short term rangebound pattern. The USD/JPY is stabilising just above 111.00

Gold is back on the back foot as the dollar remains on top. 

## Coming up today

Today we have the Swiss KOF economic barometer at 08.00. 

Spanish Flash CPI is also at 08.00.

UK net lending to individuals is at 09.30. 

## Trade Idea

Gold continues to struggle in the face of higher dollar levels. With a slew of economic data due this week, we’re likely to see volatility in prices that could push gold prices lower.
