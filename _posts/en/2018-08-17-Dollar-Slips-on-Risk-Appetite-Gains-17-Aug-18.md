## Morning Report: 07.00 London

The dollar index is on the back foot as traders drop their desire for safe havens while China-US trade talks progress. 

The AUD/USD is rising off the lows for the second day in a row. The EUR/USD is also increasing after bouncing off the 1.1300 level on Wednesday. The GBP/USD is following suit. 

After making gains yesterday for the second day in a row, the EUR/GBP is slipping back after UK retail sales increased more than expected yesterday. 

## Coming up today

Today, we have final European CPI at 10.00. 

At 13.30, we have Canadian CPI data and foreign securities purchases.

US preliminary UoM consumer sentiment is at 15.00. 

## Trade Idea

Silver has struggled of late, following gold lower as money flows into the US dollar. There is a recovery of sorts this morning, but the long term trend remains negative.
