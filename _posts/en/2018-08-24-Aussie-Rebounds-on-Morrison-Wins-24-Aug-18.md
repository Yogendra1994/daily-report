## Morning Report: 07.00 London

The Australian dollar is rebounding as Scott Morrison emerges to become the new Prime Minister. The AUD/USD sunk heavily yesterday, but the pair has recovered half those losses this morning. The AUD/JPY is recovering quicker after smaller losses yesterday. 

The euro continues to out-perform and is now the top performer on the week. The EUR/USD is on the rise again as the US Dollar retreats. The EUR/GBP is at its highest closing level for the year as the pound backs off.

The British pound is still struggling through as the latest round of Brexit plans cause more consternation. The GBP/USD is making small gains after large losses yesterday. 

The USD/CAD is on the back foot after large gains yesterday. The USD/CHF is following suit. 

The yen pairs are higher, with the USD/JPY set for four days of gains. The EUR/JPY has rebounded smartly from the August lows, the GBP/JPY is lagging though.
