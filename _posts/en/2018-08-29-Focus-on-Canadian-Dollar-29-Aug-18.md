## Morning Report: 07.00 London

The dollar index is higher this morning, but the Greenback remains near 14-week lows. 

After the conclusion of Mexico negotiations, attention now turns to Canada, with the Canadian dollar making gains this morning on the back of a four-day run. The EUR/CAD is reversing recent gains, while the GBP/CAD is testing support around 1.6600. 

After days of gains, the AUD/USD is once again heading back towards the lows. The AUD/JPY is following the same path. 

The euro is behind the pace this morning on reports that a hard Brexit will punish the EU as well as the pound with Central banks ready to act. The EUR/CHF is on the back foot, with the EUR/GBP pulling back for the first time in five sessions. The EUR/USD is also pausing its recent mini run around 1.1700. The EUR/JPY is also pausing mid August rally, failing in its test of 130.00. 

The pound is no bed of roses, with both the GBP/USD and GBP/JPY on the back foot. 

Overall, yen pairs are mixed with the USD/JPY unchanged so far today. 

## Coming up today

Today we have Canadian current account and USD prelim GDP at 13.30. 

US crude oil inventories are at 15.30. 

## Trade Idea

The Canadian dollar is advancing, with the USD/CAD dropping heavily in recent days. Its worth betting on this trend continuing though, with further downside on the cards.
