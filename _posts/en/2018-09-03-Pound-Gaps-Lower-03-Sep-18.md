## Morning Report: 07.00 London

The British pound is the main mover following Barnier’s rejection of May’s Chequers plans. This has sparked a near complete reversal of last weeks rally, with the pound gapping lower against all major currencies this morning. The GBP/JPY is the biggest loser, down by 0.51%. 

Dollar pairs are performing well, with the AUD/USD and EUR/USD reversing two days of solid losses. The euro is out performing, with the EUR/GBP and EUR/CHF mounting a counter trend rally. 

The Canadian dollar has weakened further though on fears of a trade deal failure with the US. The USD/CAD is higher again this morning. 

Meanwhile, the USD/CHF is higher after weeks of safe haven interest. 

Yen pairs are generally on the back foot as the yen exerts control. The GBP/JPY is leading the fallers, with the AUD/JPY making it three days of losses on poor retail sales data. 

## Coming up today

UK Manufacturing PMI is at 09.30. 

Buba President Weidmann speaks at 18.15.

## Trade Idea

Nothing hurts more than false hope. Last week’s Brexit rally following Barnier’s positive comments is starting to unwind against the harsh practical reality of negotiating positions. 

The EUR/GBP is higher again this morning, but it is highly feasible that we’ll see the recent highs revisited soon.
