## Morning Report: 07.00 London

The Australian dollar is on the rise this morning despite an uneventful RBA meeting which at least didn’t provide any dovish shocks. The AUD/USD is rising again off support around 0.7200, while the AUD/JPY is similarly rising off 80.00. 

The pound remains soft after the GBP/USD gapped lower on Brexit fears yesterday, while the EUR/GBP is unchanged after a surge back towards the highs. 

The EUR/USD itself is not without its struggles though as fear’s over Italy’s economy mount amid wider risk aversion to troubled economies at the periphery. The EUR/JPY is still managing to make gains however. 

The USD/CHF is making gains as the dollar regains ground against the Swiss franc. 

Meanwhile, the USD/CAD continues to rise as the dollar makes up ground against the Canadian dollar despite oil prices solidifying. 

## Coming up today

Today we have RBA Governor Lowe speaking at 10.30

UK inflation report hearings are at 13.15. 

ISM Manufacturing PMI is at 15.00. 

## Trade Idea

Gold continues to drift lower despite ongoing threats to emerging markets. 

This could speak to an underlying weakness in gold interest at present and a recovering dollar could push gold prices even lower.
