## Morning Report: 07.00 London

The US dollar index remains dominant this morning, as emerging market stress continues to generate Greenback interest. The dollar pairs are mixed this morning, with the USD/CAD of particular interest as the Canadian dollar continues to suffer as trade negotiations drag on. The USD/CAD has now risen for five straight days. 

The USD/CHF also rose sharply yesterday, though is pulling back this morning as money flows back into the Swissy. 

The EUR/USD and GBP/USD are unchanged so far this morning as both came under pressure yesterday on Brexit fears and poor UK construction PMI data. The EUR/GBP is edging slightly higher after a reversal yesterday. 

The Australian dollar is unchanged at the lows after failing to hold the 0.7200 level yesterday. 

Yen pairs have a slight positive bias, building on recent gains. 

Gold continues to slowly drift lower after failing to hold the $1200 level. 

## Coming up today

UK services PMI is at 09.30

Canadian trade balance and Labor productivity are at 13.30. 

At 15.00, we have the BOC rate statement. 

## Trade Idea

The AUD/USD continues to struggle, with more downsides on the cards after the breaking of the 0.7200.
