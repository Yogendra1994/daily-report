## Morning Report: 07.00 London

The US dollar is strengthening as trade war fears increase again, index is on the rise after a volatile session yesterday. The biggest effect is being seen on the AUD/USD, as the Aussie slips back to 26 month low against the US dollar on fears that trade disputes will hit China’s economy. The AUD/JPY is also on the back foot, slipping back towards 79.00. 

The EUR/USD continues to struggle with the 1.1600 handle, down again today on emerging market concerns. The GBP/USD failed to build on Monday’s momentum, with follow on selling this morning to test the 1.3000 level. 

The USD/CAD is slightly higher this morning, but the damage was done yesterday as traders buy up the Canadian dollar on hopes of a trade deal.  

The yen pairs are on the back foot as the dollar gives way to yen in the safe haven stakes. The USD/JPY is on the back foot this morning as are most other yen pairs. 

## Coming up today

Today we have US PPI at 13.30. 

US crude oil inventories are at 15.30. 

FOMC Member Brainard speaks at 17.45. 

## Trade Idea

The AUD/USD continues to struggle, but there are still grounds for pessimism as the Aussie economy catches a Chinese cold.
