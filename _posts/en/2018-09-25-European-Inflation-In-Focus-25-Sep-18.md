## Morning Report: 07.00 London

This morning, the dollar is back in control amid general uncertainty in other safe haven regions. 

The AUD/ USD is weak again for the second straight day as Chinese stock markets slump and Australia catches a cold by proximity. 

The euro is holding up ok following ECB President Draghi’s speech which highlighted price pressures across Europe. The EUR/USD is making tentative losses after a volatile session yesterday. The EUR/JPY continues to make gains, with the pair set to challenge the highs once again. This says more about yen weakness than euro strength. The EUR/GBP is unchanged after pressure yesterday as the pound found some of its mojo. The biggest gains for the euro have come against the Swiss franc, with the EUR/CHF rising as the Swiss falls under favour. 

The GBP/USD put in a good showing yesterday after Friday’s significant losses. The downtrend is continuing this morning though. The GBP/JPY is continuing to recover from Friday’s losses. 

The swiss franc continues to struggle against the weight of the US dollar, with the USD/CHF rallying. 

The USD/CAD is continuing its rebound as the dollar regains its poise. 

The USD/JPY continues to perform well as yen interest diminishes. 

## Coming up today

Coming up today, we have MPC member Vliegh speaking at 09.40. 

At 15.00, we have CB Consumer Confidence. 

## Trade Idea

The Japanese economy continues to plod amid fears of productivity slumps towards the end of Abe’s premiership.
