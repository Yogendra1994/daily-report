## Morning Report: 07.00 London

This morning, there is still a mixed reaction to yesterday’s FOMC meeting where the Fed raised rates by 0.25% as expected, but kept additional guidance mostly the same as last month. 

Most dollar pairs including the EUR/USD slipped yesterday, but there is a hint of a recovery this morning. The biggest win for the dollar came against the Canadian dollar, with the USD/CAD jumping to test 1.3050. 

The AUD/USD has been out-performing however, with the pair holding at the 0.7200, building on Chinese strength. 

A big exception is the GBP/USD, which is experiencing follow on selling after failing to break 1.3200 yesterday. The EUR/GBP broke lost ground yesterday, in favour of the pound, but those losses have been overcome with buying pressure so far this morning.  

The USD/JPY slipped from the highs yesterday after failing to break the 113.00 level. The EUR/JPY also struggled to break resistance at 133.00. The GBP/JPY is experiencing follow on selling as the yen takes control. 

## Coming up today

At 09.00, we have European M3 Money Supply.

At 13.30, we get US core durable goods orders, released alongside final GDP. 

ECB President Draghi speaks at 14.30. 

Fed Chair Powell speaks at 21.30. 

BOC Governor Poloz speaks at 22.45. 

## Trade Idea

The Australian dollar, like all dollar pairs is hardly pulling up trees at the moment, with press on the Chinese economy in the face of tariffs. 

With the Fed keeping to a rate hike path, there could be further downside for the AUD/USD.
