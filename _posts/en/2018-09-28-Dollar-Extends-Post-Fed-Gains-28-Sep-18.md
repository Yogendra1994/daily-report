## Morning Report: 07.00 London

The US dollar is experiencing an amount of selling pressure, but yesterday’s post-Fed gains are still unthreatened. The dollar remains the currency of choice for traders with its well communicated rate path pointing firmly higher. 

The EUR/USD is recovering to test the 1.1650 level after huge losses yesterday, with the pair falling from 1.1750. The market is nervous as the Italian populist party pushed through a higher spending plan. The EUR/GBP also slumped further, with most of last week’s gains now erased. 

The euro came under pressure, but the Swiss franc sunk even further, with the EUR/CHF making gains. The Swissy was one of the biggest losers against the dollar yesterday, with the USD/CHF punching above 0.9750. 

The GBP/USD came in for selling pressure yesterday, but held up better than its peers. The AUD/USD also sunk back towards the lows yesterday. 

The USD/JPY exploded back towards the highs, closing in on 113.50. Other yen pairs are making small gains this morning after a mixed performance yesterday.
