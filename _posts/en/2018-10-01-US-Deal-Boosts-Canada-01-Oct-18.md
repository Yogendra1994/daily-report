## Morning Report: 07.00 London

The Canadian dollar is the top performer, boosted by the news of a new US, Canadian and Mexican trade deal. The Canadian dollar has jumped higher, with the USD/CAD dropping to below 1.2850. The Canadian dollar is making even bigger gains against the likes of the pound and euro. 

The euro remains under pressure, with the EUR/USD dropping below 1.1600 after failing at 1.1750 last week. After days of gains, the EUR/CHF is on the back foot as the Swiss franc finally finds buyers. The EUR/GBP is unchanged however. 

The 1.3000 level is holding for the GBP/USD for now as the pound beats to the dollarâ€™s drum. 

The Aussie is also lower, but with a softer decline as the 0.7200 level holds. 

The US dollar continues to make gains against the yen, with the USD/JPY challenging 114.00 level.
