## Morning Report: 07.00 London

The EUR/USD is rebounding off support around 1.1550 as Italy concerns ease. This reverses yesterday’s losses which marked five days of losses. The EUR/GBP is also on the rise, building on yesterday’s losses as Brexit concerns slow down the pound. The EUR/CHF is also making gains this morning and is heading for its highest closing high since August. The EUR/JPY is also reversing recent losses as support around 131.00 holds. 

The GBP/USD is also making gains following yesterday’s failure of 1.3000, with support now becoming resistance. 

Other dollar pairs are on the back foot, with the AUD/USD slipping back. The USD/CAD is unchanged and holding last week’s gap lower. The USD/CHF continues to strengthen as safe haven demand diminishes and the dollar takes in safe haven flow. 

The USD/JPY is back on the rise after reversing from the high of 114.00 level. The AUD/JPY also hit the brakes hard yesterday, but 81.50 held.

## Trade Idea

The euro remains resilient in the face of Italy concerns which hints at underlying strength. There could be further upside from here on the EUR/USD despite underlying dollar strength.
