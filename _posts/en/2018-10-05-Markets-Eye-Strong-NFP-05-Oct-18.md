## Morning Report: 07.00 London

The dollar remains strong this morning, with markets expecting a strong set of NFP numbers. The Australian dollar remains weak, falling further below the 0.7100 level. 

The EUR/USD recovered half of yesterday’s losses, but is back on the losing track this morning. The GBP/USD rallied sharply back above the 1.3000 level yesterday, with this morning’s selling set to challenge support again. 

The USD/CAD has recovered the October gap to recover the 1.2900 level. The USD/CHF is also continuing its push towards parity, with 0.9950 the next target.

Yen pairs remain on the back foot, with the USD/JPY reversing steadily yesterday. The AUD/JPY remains weak, selling off for the last four days. The GBP/JPY and EUR/JPY also remain weak. 

## Coming up today

The day’s big ticket is US non-farm employment change at 13.30, released alongside unemployment rates and average hourly earnings. 

Canadian employment change, unemployment rate and trade balance are released at the same time. 

## Trade Idea

The Aussie remains weak, with the yen holding its own against most currencies with the exception of the dollar.
