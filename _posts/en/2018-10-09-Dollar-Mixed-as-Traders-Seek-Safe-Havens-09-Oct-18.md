## Morning Report: 07.00 London

This morning, markets are choppy on growing concerns that are limiting risk appetite. Concerns mount over emerging currencies, China and the Italian economy. 

The USD/JPY continues to fall from the highs around 114.50, with support at 113.00 the latest test. The EUR/JPY is following a similar path, with steady selling from 133.00 – The 130.00 level is holding for now. The GBP/JPY sold off yesterday like other yen pairs, but from a much stronger base. The AUD/JPY is out performing through, with the 80.00 level holding. 

The AUD/USD is the exception amongst dollar pairs, rallying for the second day in a row. 

The GBP/USD is slightly higher and holding up well on Brexit hopes, while the EUR/USD continues to struggle on Italy concerns. The EUR/GBP’s trend remains firmly lower, hitting its lowest level since June. 

The USD/CHF’s power trend remains higher, pausing just below 0.9950. The USD/CAD’s uptrend remains firmly on track despite a rejection of the 1.3000 level yesterday. 

## Coming up today

Today we have MPC Member Broadbent speaking at 15.35. 

## Trade Idea

The pound is gathering some genuine Brexit momentum right now, while the euro faces increasing concerns over the state of Italian banks and bond market. 

The EUR/GBP has sold off heavily in the past few weeks, but there could be room for further selling if bond concerns intensify.
