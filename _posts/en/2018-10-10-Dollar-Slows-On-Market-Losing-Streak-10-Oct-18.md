## Morning Report: 07.00 London

Stock markets are continuing their losing streak, with US yields rises stabilising. In this environment, the US dollar is struggling, helping dollar pairs to rise. 

The AUD/USD is higher for the third day in a row, as the 0.7050 level holds. The GBP/USD remains strong, notching up small gains this morning as sterling continues to rise towards the September highs. 

The euro continues to lag, with the EUR/USD volatile yesterday, but ultimately finishing slightly higher, with small gains this morning. The EUR/GBP remains pressured after dropping below 87.50 yesterday. The EUR/CHF is mixed, with the 1.1400 level holding for now. 

The USD/CAD reversed yesterday following five days of gains as the dollar finally gave up its recent pressure. The USD/CHF is stuck just below 0.9950 as the dollar and Swiss franc safe haven cancel each other out. 

The USD/JPY is making small gains after slumping from 114.50 last week on strong demand for the Japanese yen. The AUD/JPY and EUR/JPY are following a similar pattern with two days of gains following consecutive losses. The GBP/JPY continues to hold up relatively well though, staying within reach of the highs. 

## Coming up today

Today, we have UK GDP and manufacturing production at 09.30. 

MPC member Haldane speaks at 10.00. 

US PPI is at 13.30. 

FOMC member Bostic speaks at 23.00. 

## Trade Idea

The Australian dollar has recovered well these last few days as the dollar backs off the pace. However, considerable risks still remain with China a tinder box of risk. The long term trend is lower and it could pay to stick with this.
