## Morning Report: 07.00 London

The British pound remains the poorest performer on talk of a delay to the Brexit transition period. The GBP/USD is off by o.79% on the week to date. Meanwhile, the GBP/JPY is breaking support around 146.00, while the EUR/GBP is pulling back after stretching higher to 0.8850 yesterday. 

The AUD/USD is struggling at the lows, with follow on selling towards the 0.7050 level. The AUD/JPY is lower for the second straight day, testing the 79.50 level. 

The euro is also falling in the face of dollar strength (and Trump belligerence), with the EUR/USD slipping to 1.1450 the support level with follow on selling this morning. The EUR/JPY is also slipping, with half of Friday’s gains now erased. 

The USD/CAD is unchanged as the pair holds as the Canadian dollar recovers confidence. Meanwhile, the USD/CHF is staying close to the parity line around 1.000. 

The US dollar index is pulling back after making big gains yesterday, with the USD/JPY erasing most of yesterday’s losses. 

## Coming up today

Today, wee have UK MPC member Haldane speaking at 23.30. 

BOE governor Carney speaks at 16.20. 

FOMC member Bostic speaks at 18.30. 

## Trade Idea

The euro continues to weaken while the dollar goes from strength to strength. Recent lows are a likely target, making a ONE TOUCH trade attractive.
