## Morning Report: 07.00 London

The US dollar remains dominant despite a Chinese manufacturing flashing a warning and coming in below estimates. Risk appetite is clearly on the rise, and dollar confidence near its highest levels for the year. 

The EUR/USD and GBP/USD are unchanged at the lows this morning after further selling yesterday. The pound came in for the heaviest selling yesterday after Chancellor Hammond gave large caveats in his budget around the impact of Brexit. 

The Canadian dollar is on the back foot, with the USD/CAD rising above new support around 1.3100.

Meanwhile, the USD/CHF is trading firmly above the parity line after further gains yesterday. 

The AUD/USD is the big exception as it made gains yesterday in the face of dollar strength. 

The yen pairs are on the rise as traders shun the need for safe havens. Other yen pairs are enjoying gains, with the AUD/JPY making the biggest advances up from the highs. 

## Coming up today

Coming up today we have Spanish flash GDP at 08.00. 

European CPI flash estimate is at 10.00. 

US ADP non-farm employment change is at 12.15. 

Canadian GDP is at 12.30, released alongside RMPI. 

US crude oil inventories are also at 14.30. 

SNB chairman Jordan speaks at 17.15. 

Canadian Governor Poloz speaks at 20.15. 

## Trade Idea

The pound has sunk lower to hit support levels, but there could be lower levels still to go as the dollar hits its straps.
