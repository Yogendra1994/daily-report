## Morning Report: 07.00 London

The dollar index remains on the back foot this morning, giving dollar pairs a moderate boost. The GBP/USD continues to hold gains on Brexit hopes despite the lack of concrete progress in recent days. The EUR/USD is struggling though after falling back yesterday. The EUR/GBP is drifting lower again as a consequence, with 0.8700 the next target. 

The AUD/USD continues to out-perform, with November seeing five winning sessions out of six. 

The USD/CHF is back above the parity line after a volatile session yesterday that saw the pair dip below the parity line at certain points in the day. 

The yen pairs are on the front foot, as the USD/JPY travels above 113.50 as the yen interest diminishes in current times of risk appetite. The GBP/JPY is continuing its excellent run, holding above 149.00. The EUR/JPY is higher, but lagging and struggling to push through 130.00. 

The AUD/JPY is the top performer, with six solid winning sessions so far in November and now holding well above 82.50. 

## Coming up today

At 10.00, we have EU Economic Forecast. 

Swiss Governing Borad Member Maevchler speaks at 17.30. 

At 19.00, we have the FOMC statement, with no change expected. 

## Trade Idea

The Australian dollar continues to out-perform, while the yen remains under pressure. The AUD/JPY has moves well in November and there could be further upside from here.
