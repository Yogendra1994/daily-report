## Morning Report: 07.00 London

The US dollar is pulling back from the 2018 highs, with dollar pairs enjoying a relief rally. 

Both the euro and the pound were hit by Brexit uncertainty yesterday, with the euro coming in for intensive selling on concerns over Italy. The EUR/USD made fresh 12 month lows, falling below 1.1250, with small gains this morning. The GBP/USD also suffered from selling pressure, but held up better, forcing the EUR/GBP lower yesterday despite Brexit fears. 

The AUD/USD is one of the top performers this morning, buoyed by China confidence. 

The USD/CAD is on the back foot after the Canadian dollar enjoyed gains from higher oil prices. 

The USD/CHF closed at its highest levels since early 2017 yesterday as dollar dominance sucked money out of the safe haven Swissy. 

Yen pairs are higher this morning, with the AUD/JPY leading the way and erasing most of yesterdayâ€™s losses. 

## Coming up today

Today we have UK average earnings at 09.30, alongside the unemployment rate. 

German ZEW economic sentiment is at 10.00. 

US FOMC Member Brainard speaks at 15.00. 

## Trade Idea

The euro and Aussie are heading in opposite directions, with the latter helped by renewed China confidence.
