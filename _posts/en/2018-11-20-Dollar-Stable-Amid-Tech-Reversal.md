## Morning Report: 07.00 London

The dollar index is stable despite further selling of US technology stocks last night. The Nasdaq 100, home to Apple, Amazon and Microsoft et al sold off by over 3% and is sitting at the lows. 

Dollar pairs are mixed this morning, with the Australian dollar struggling on release of the latest RBA meeting minutes which pointed out a number of risks on the horizon. Both the AUD/USD and AUD/JPY are selling for the second straight day after gapping lower Monday morning. 

Both the EUR/USD and GBP/USD are unchanged this morning with both making moderate gains yesterday. The euro maintains the upper hand, with the EUR/GBP making gains in four out of the last five sessions with small losses this morning. The EUR/JPY is making slow progress against yen strength, while the GBP/JPY is at least unchanged this morning after struggling against the yen. 

The Swiss franc is resurgent though, forcing the USD/CHF below the parity line for the first time this month as investors seek out safe havens. 

There have been similar moves on the USD/JPY which extended Fridayâ€™s losses yesterday and is unchanged so far this morning. The yen is picking up interest as the dollar softens amid the tech sell-off.  

## Coming up today

Today we have UK inflation report hearings at 10.00. 

US building permits and housing starts are at 13.30. 

German Buba President Weidmann speaks at 15.00. 

## Trade Idea

The Swiss Franc is back in demand, helping the EUR/CHF to slip lower in line with the longer term trend of euro weakness. 

While the dollar backs off and with risk appetite increasing, now could be a good time to bet on further Swissy strength.
