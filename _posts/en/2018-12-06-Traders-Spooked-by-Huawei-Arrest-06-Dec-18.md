## Morning Report: 07.00 London

Markets have been hit by a wave of risk-aversion on the arrest of Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou. The yen is in demand, along with safe haven favourite the Swiss franc. 

Yen pairs are on the back foot, led by the rapid collapse of the AUD/JPY which is being hit due to its close reliance on the Chinese economy. The pair is down by nearly 1% today and 2% over the last 48 hours. 

The EUR/JPY and GBP/JPY have reversed most of yesterdayâ€™s gains on general risk aversion. The USD/JPY is also on the back foot, though with only moderate selling on dollar strength. 

The dollar index is testing the November highs as money flows back into safer havens. The AUD/USD is experiencing the biggest falls across dollar pairs, dropping from 0.7400 to 0.7200 in the space of a week. 

The EUR/USD is down, while the GBP/USD is holding up relatively well after two volatile days of trading. 

The USD/CAD has push to its highest levels for 2018 after three days of solid gains. 

The USD/CHF was rejected from the parity line once again, but there are small gains made this morning.

## Trade Idea

The Aussie dollar has been hit hard by China contagion, slipping back hard in the last few days. 

The long term trend remains negative, making a lower trade attractive.
