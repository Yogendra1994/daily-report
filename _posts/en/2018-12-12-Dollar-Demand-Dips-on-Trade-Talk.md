## Morning Report: 07.00 London

This morning, the US dollar index is dipping from the highs on general relief that trade talks are ongoing between the US and China. Risk appetite is increasing, helping dollar pairs to lift off the lows. 

The EUR/USD is rising, though remains rangebound between highs and lows from mid-November. The GBP/USD is actually rising this morning after two days of losses that saw the pair drop below 1.2500 briefly. The EUR/GBP is slipping back after three days of significant gains. 

The USD/CAD has dropped a little further back from the highs on general dollar ease. The USD/CHF is unchanged after bouncing off the 0.9900 levels.

The main exception to this dollar weakness is the AUD/USD which has pulled back this morning. 

The USD/JPY is on the back foot, helped by dollar interest waning. By contrast, other pairs including the AUD/JPY, GBP/JPY and EUR/JPY are advancing.  

## Coming up today

Today, we have US CPI at 13.30. 

## Trade Idea

The USD/CHF is back on the rise this morning after testing the 0.9900 level briefly. The parity line remains within reach though and hitting levels above 1.0025 remains a distinct possibility.
