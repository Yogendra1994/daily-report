## Morning Report: 07.00 London

The dollar index is down slightly after staging a post Fed rally on expectations of a bullish rate path. Overall there are mixed fortunes for dollar pairs. 

The AUD/USD is lower again this morning after heavy selling yesterday that continues the December decline. 

The GBP/USD is higher slightly after moderate losses yesterday. By contrast. The EUR/USD continues to outperform, rising for the fourth day in a row despite yesterday’s dollar strength. The EUR/GBP is slightly higher, but the euro’s dominance was clear in yesterday’s rally. 

The USD/CAD is continuing its upswing however as the US dollar dominates the weakening Canadian dollar. The dollar is falling against the Swiss franc however, with the USD/CHF reversing most of yesterday’s losses. 

While the dollar rose yesterday, it is the yen that is controlling currency moves. The USD/JPY dropped heavily this morning to test the 112.00 level. 

The AUD/JPY continues to see spectacular selling, dropping 4.4% for the month of December. 

Both the EUR/JPY and GBP/JPY are on the back foot, with the latter testing the December lows. 

## Coming up today

UK retail sales are at 09.30. 

At 12.00, we have the MPC policy statement, with no change expected. 

## Trade Idea

The pound continues to trade with a Brexit millstone around its next and this could see further downside for the GBP/JPY.
