The dollar index is on the rise this morning after heavy selling yesterday. The biggest counter move is against the yen which surged on Thursday as markets took fright at a range of global risks and took comfort in the yen. The USD/JPY plunged below 111.00 yesterday, but is recovering to test the 111.50 level. 

Other yen pairs are recovering, with the EUR/JPY climbing back above support at 127.50 after yesterday’s drop. The GBP/JPY also attempting a recovery after dropping to its lowest levels since the Summer. 

Dollar pairs are generally on the back foot, with the EUR/USD reversing the week’s gains to test 1.1450 from the upside. The GBP/USD remains depressed near the lows with moderate losses this morning. The EUR/GBP remains close to the 0.9050 level as the euro dominates the pound. 

The USD/CAD continues to advance, with the pair trading above 1.35000 this morning as oil prices continue their decline after gapping below $60 at the start of the week. 

Some of the biggest moves were seen on the USD/CHF which broke out the recent trading range to plunge below 0.9880.
