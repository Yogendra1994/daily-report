## Morning Report: 07.00 London

The dollar index is pulling back further this morning, testing the December lows as traders shun the need for safe havens amid hope of a trade deal between the US and China. 

Dollar pairs are higher, led by the AUD/USD which has recovered from the New Year flash crash to trade well above the 2019 lows. The EUR/USD is gapping higher, making gains for the third day in a row, with the GBP/USD following suit. The EUR/GBP is slightly higher after the euro sold off heavily against the pound on Friday. 

The USD/CAD continues to fall off a cliff, gapping lower this morning. 

The USD/CHF is also continuing its slow decline, breaking through its trading range. 

The yen pairs are on the back foot, with the USD/JPY unwinding some of last weeks gains. Yen pairs have recovered some but by no means not all of the losses from last weeks flash crash. The EUR/JPY and GBP/JPY are following the same moves, as is the AUD/JPY which saw the most impressive recovery last week. 

Gold is back on the offensive this morning, climbing back to $1290 after dropping from the highs on Friday. The uptrend remains firmly intact.

## Coming up today

Today we have US ISM Non-Manufacturing PMI at 15.00. At the same time we have Canadian Ivey PMI.

## Trade Idea

The USD/CAD has gapped lower this morning, but opening gaps have been closed with some regularity recently. 

The US dollar may be under some pressure, but the Canadian dollarâ€™s fortunes are also circumspect, with oil prices remaining depressed.
