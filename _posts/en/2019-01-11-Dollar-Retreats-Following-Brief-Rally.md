## Morning Report: 07.00 London

The US dollar index is reversing most of yesterday’s rally. Dollar pairs are back on the rise after some reversals yesterday. 

The EUR/USD was hit hard yesterday, falling to 1.1500 with moderate gains this morning. The GBP/USD is lagging this morning though after failing at the 1.2800 level yesterday. The AUD/USD is extending recent momentum though, with the pair pushing through the 0.7200 level. 

The USD/CHF took full advantage of dollar strength yesterday, erasing the bulk of the week’s losses with a solid rally and only small losses this morning. The Swiss franc sunk yesterday as demand for safe havens diminished amid trade talk hopes. The EUR/CHF jumped higher yesterday, with follow on gains this morning. 

The USD/CAD is extending the 2019 bear swing, testing the 1.3200 level following a measured rally yesterday. 

The yen pairs are showing small gains, with the AUD/JPY leading the back and breaking fresh highs for 2019. There are small gains across the board for other yen pairs including the EUR/JPY, GBP/JPY and USD/JPY. 

## Coming up today

UK GDP and manufacturing production are at 09.30. 

US CPI is released at 13.30. 

## Trade Idea

The AUD/USD continues to outperform its peers, helped by better than expected retail sales this morning. As the dollar continues to slip, there could be further upside for the AUD/USD.
