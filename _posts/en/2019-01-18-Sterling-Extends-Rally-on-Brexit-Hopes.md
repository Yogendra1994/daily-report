## Morning Report: 07.00 London

Markets are quiet this morning as traders pause for breath following yesterday’s moves. The British pound remains in a strong position, with the GBP/USD sitting just below 1.3000 following Thursday’s sizeable rally. The GBP/JPY is higher for the fifth day out of six, while the EUR/GBP continues to slump after euro gave serious ground to the pound yesterday to break through 0.8800 for the first time in 2019. 

Away from the pound, dollar pairs are mixed, with the EUR/USD continuing to struggle and sitting below 1.1400. The AUD/USD is unchanged so far after testing the 0.7200 for the last six sessions. 

The USD/CAD is on the back foot, as yesterday’s recovery rally stalled at 1.3300. 

Meanwhile, the USD/CHF made another recovery rally yesterday, falling just short of pushing through the 0.9950 level yesterday. 

The USD/JPY continues to make gains on the week, with the AUD/JPY also following suit and even the lagging EUR/JPY making gains.
