## Morning Report: 07.00 London

The British pound is maintaining its moderate sell-off as Tory division and the realism of Theresa May’s revised plans cause the week’s previous Brexit confidence to wane. The GBP/USD is down only slightly, but this comes amid a morning of general strength for dollar pairs. Similarly, the GBP/JPY is unchanged while other yen pairs make small gains. The EUR/GBP is rallying for the third straight day. 

The dollar index is on the back foot, helping the dollar pairs to make moderate gains. The AUD/USD is slightly higher despite China growth concerns. The EUR/USD is making gains for the third straight day, having pushed firmly off support around 1.1300. 

The USD/CAD is on the back foot on general dollar weakness and testing support around 1.3250. The USD/CHF is unchanged but holding recent losses. 

The USD/JPY is unchanged so far as the yen and dollar cancel each other out. The EUR/JPY is showing positive intent and is set to test the 125.00 level from below. The GBP/JPY is lagging though.
